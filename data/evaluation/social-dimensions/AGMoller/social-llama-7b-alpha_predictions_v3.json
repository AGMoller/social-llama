I see a huge parallel between roleplaying games and theatre - you are relating to people in the room on-the-fly as fictional people; you interact with your fellow players mainly through dialogue; you're co-creating a story together; RPG stories often follow similar dramatic structures.

This has, from my understanding, been a contentious issue in Texas, specifically regarding dashcams, because of the strange language of the law.

Your description of your experience sounds kind of awful imho, and similar to my experience as well. I've never completed a game of Catan, partly because I didn't really get what I was supposed to be trying to accomplish in the game and the other players lost interest as well. I guess I picked the wrong starting locations because my turn was last so I was screwed out of getting any resource types anyone cared about throughout the entire game, and the few things I could scrounge up were stolen by the robber.
