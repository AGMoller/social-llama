That's a massive, massive accusation you're making there and would undermine our entire justice system. I suspect that's likely because they're literally a racist and being sent to prison for a long time, and people are not trying to explain what they've done is a bad thing - because nobody needs convincing.

Forgiveness means that you let go of our anger and your claim of a right to seek revenge. You can and should forgive her because that's more about reducing your own stress level than it is about her. (And it needs to be an honest forgiving, not a passive aggressive thing.)

We continued this ritual from primary school all the way up to the end of secondary school when the show ended, Me and my dad shed a tear at the final episode. Thanks Adam for being such an important and awesome part of my life and for giving me those memories with my dad, much love to you and yours, keep killing it.

        "prediction": "  The social dimension of the given text is \"power\".\n\nIn the text, the author is discussing how the phone industry has historically operated under a subsidy model, where the phone company bears the cost of the phone's high price and recoups it over time through the customer's service contract. This model gives the phone company power over the customer, as the customer is locked into a contract and must pay a higher price for the phone.
