It's a survival mechanism during hostage situations that becomes inflated as a result of the intensity and duration of the situation. That's not what happens on the other side of screens; the opposite is true, that people will always tend to be crueler, pass more judgment and ignore opposing perspective when the \"\"freak\"\" being targeted is not someone you will ever have to actually confront. Saying we need to understand the personality of pedophiles doesn't mean you need to let them babysit your kids. This reductive, ideological skewing of logic is why we'd rather throw people like drug addicts in prison than attempt to fix the conditions that turned them into unproductive or violent people.\"\nAnswer: [/INST]",
        "prediction": "  The social dimension of the given text is \"power\".\n\nThe text discusses the power dynamics between individuals and groups, particularly in the context of hostage situations and online interactions. It highlights how people tend to be more cruel and judgmental towards others they will never have to confront in person, and how this can lead to a skewed understanding of complex social issues like pedophilia. The author argues that rather than throwing people in prison, we should address the underlying conditions that contribute to their unproductive or violent behavior.\n\nThe text touches on other social dimensions, such as \"conflict\" (the tension between different perspectives and groups), \"trust\" (the lack of trust in institutions and individuals), and \"respect\" (the lack of respect for certain groups or individuals), but \"power\" is the primary social dimension at play in the text.",

I'm working on an RPG system that is centered around the mechanics of dialogue, interaction, drama, and the development of rich interpersonal stories. This system is very heavily derived from systems of approaching plays as an actor. I see a huge parallel between roleplaying games and theatre - you are relating to people in the room on-the-fly as fictional people; you interact with your fellow players mainly through dialogue; you're co-creating a story together; RPG stories often follow similar dramatic structures. Most acting techniques intentionally avoid systematizing emotion because: 1.\nAnswer: [/INST]",

Stories similar to your friend's are unfortunately common among our participants. But it is *somewhat* of a relief (a tiny, tiny one) that courts (in my area, at least) are increasingly recognizing the significance of childhood trauma and taking that into consideration in sentencing. And programs like ours actually seem to be working. We recently helped a traumatized kid initially facing 2 years in prison for a drug charge ultimately end up with probation, substance abuse treatment (including group and individual therapy) and vocational training.\nAnswer: [/INST]",

To the best of my knowledge, you have to be a party to the conversation being recorded. If you're not with the car, like when it's with a mechanic, and you record a conversation then no party would be consenting; that's presuming that no party is aware of the dashcam or that it's recording. This has, from my understanding, been a contentious issue in Texas, specifically regarding dashcams, because of the strange language of the law. Essentially, it's illegal to 'eavesdrop' by recording a conversation that you're not party to, potentially even without having the expectation of privacy.\nAnswer: [/INST]",

        "prediction": "  The social dimension of the text is \"power\". The text discusses how the subsidy model in phone plans gives power to the phone companies to set prices higher due to the need to recoup their investment, and how this model can lead to overcharging for single line users compared to family plans. The power dynamic is evident in the way the companies have control over the prices and plans, and how the users are affected by these decisions.",
