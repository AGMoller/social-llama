The author notes that their Christian friends who they had known since childhood were particularly devastated, as they believed the author was now destined for hell.\n\nThe theme of trust is evident in the text as the author discusses the reliability and loyalty of their friends and family. The author trusted their friends and family to be supportive and understanding of their decision, but instead, they faced a range of reactions. This highlights the importance of trust in social interactions and the impact it can have on relationships.",

I see a huge parallel between roleplaying games and theatre - you are relating to people in the room on-the-fly as fictional people; you interact with your fellow players mainly through dialogue; you're co-creating a story together; RPG stories often follow similar dramatic structures. Most acting techniques intentionally avoid systematizing emotion because: 1.\nAnswer: [/INST]",

To the best of my knowledge, you have to be a party to the conversation being recorded. If you're not with the car, like when it's with a mechanic, and you record a conversation then no party would be consenting; that's presuming that no party is aware of the dashcam or that it's recording. This has, from my understanding, been a contentious issue in Texas, specifically regarding dashcams, because of the strange language of the law. Essentially, it's illegal to 'eavesdrop' by recording a conversation that you're not party to, potentially even without having the expectation of privacy.\nAnswer: [/INST]",
