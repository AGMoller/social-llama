Stories similar to your friend's are unfortunately common among our participants. But it is *somewhat* of a relief (a tiny, tiny one) that courts (in my area, at least) are increasingly recognizing the significance of childhood trauma and taking that into consideration in sentencing. And programs like ours actually seem to be working. We recently helped a traumatized kid initially facing 2 years in prison for a drug charge ultimately end up with probation, substance abuse treatment (including group and individual therapy) and vocational training.\nAnswer: [/INST]",

To the best of my knowledge, you have to be a party to the conversation being recorded. If you're not with the car, like when it's with a mechanic, and you record a conversation then no party would be consenting; that's presuming that no party is aware of the dashcam or that it's recording. This has, from my understanding, been a contentious issue in Texas, specifically regarding dashcams, because of the strange language of the law. Essentially, it's illegal to 'eavesdrop' by recording a conversation that you're not party to, potentially even without having the expectation of privacy.\nAnswer: [/INST]",

        "prediction": "  The social dimension of the text is \"respect\". The text disrespectfully refers to individuals who are obese as \"lazy\" and \"gluttonous\", implying that they are to blame for their weight. It also perpetuates harmful stereotypes and stigmas against people who are obese, suggesting that their weight is a personal failing rather than a complex issue that can involve a variety of factors, including genetics, environment, and societal pressures. By dismissing the idea that weight issues can be fixed, the text also denies the legitimacy of the experiences and struggles of people who are obese.",
