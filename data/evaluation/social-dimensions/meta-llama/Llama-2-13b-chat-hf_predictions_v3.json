It's also important to acknowledge whether that shift will occur, and how to maximise the chances. There's a real danger that automation will lead to further concentration of wealth and greater inequality. Once automation is the norm and human labour is much less required the owners of automotons will have less need to support those who previously provided labour. Think about it this way: the world has a finite supply of resources.\nAnswer: [/INST]",

I'm working on an RPG system that is centered around the mechanics of dialogue, interaction, drama, and the development of rich interpersonal stories. This system is very heavily derived from systems of approaching plays as an actor. I see a huge parallel between roleplaying games and theatre - you are relating to people in the room on-the-fly as fictional people; you interact with your fellow players mainly through dialogue; you're co-creating a story together; RPG stories often follow similar dramatic structures. Most acting techniques intentionally avoid systematizing emotion because: 1.\nAnswer: [/INST]",

We did discuss Net Neutrality, foreign policy with Russia, local issues, recent Hollywood sex scandals, and a few other topics. We didn't discuss religion, I just found interesting how our discussions aligned with your examples. My final sentence in the previous post was a very broad statement but it has been true throughout history. For example socialism in the Gilded Age American and in the late 19th century Russia was a frequent discussion within educated (probably somewhat powerful) households.\nAnswer: [/INST]",
