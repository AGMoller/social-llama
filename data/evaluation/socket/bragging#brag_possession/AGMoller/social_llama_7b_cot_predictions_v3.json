I understand that you are expressing a concern about worrying too much about others and feeling like it would be better if you focused more on yourself. However, I don't think it's accurate to label this statement as \"bragging about a possession.\"\n\nBragging typically involves boasting about one's accomplishments or possessions in a way that is excessive or arrogant. While it's understandable to feel frustrated with the way you're feeling, there's no evidence in your statement to suggest that you're bragging about anything.\n\nInstead, it seems like you're simply expressing a genuine concern and desire to find a balance between caring for yourself and caring for others. This is a common and relatable feeling, and it's okay to acknowledge and work through it.\n\nSo, I would label your statement as \"not possession bragging.\"",
