This is what gives us stuff like Pokémon Let's Go, which were considered very lackluster remakes with less effort put in them than the remakes that were released over ten years before and what also makes us buy games that are no more than beta versions, since DLC/complete versions come out the year later.

I feel like I've missed out on a lot of things I should've had experienced by now & that it's probably too late to catch up. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Every day is as boring as the previous one. If someone was looking at me all day, all they would see would be some fat guy sitting in front of a gigantic screen with a poker face. [linebreak]  [linebreak] It's sad, man. Every year I feel like it's too late to change, only to regret not having tried one year later. I wish I could go back in time and tell 17 years old me that no, it's not too late to get in shape, as you'll still wish to be ripped when you're 21. Or go back and tell 18 years old me that it is too early to give up any hopes of ever kissing a girl or having a social life. The list goes on. But sadly, I can't change my past. [linebreak]  [linebreak] What's even more depressing is that it is pretty much entirely my fault. Yes, I do have overprotective parents, but I should have done something. If only I had told them to fuck off whenever they asked where I was going, with who, and that endless amount of questions they asked (and still ask) me every time I opened the door, my life could have been a lot more different. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Nowadays, I often act against my own interests solely out of fear. For example: some weeks ago, I messaged a girl I had been texting for around a month (I don't know if I like her as a friend & it's just my mind playing tricks on me because of my inexperience or if I actually like her romantically) at around 3 am and since I didn't get an answer half an hour later I decided to pop some sleeping pills and head to bed. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Right after waking up, I saw her reply. She answered 10 minutes after I knocked myself out. Said she was at some club and told me to drop by if I wanted. A few minutes later, she mentioned that she was going to the beach later if I wanted to go. And that she was leaving the town we both were at at a certain hour. [linebreak]  [linebreak] What did I do? I saw the message an hour before she said she would leave (in the notification panel with my phone in flight mode so she wouldn't know I saw it) and answered an hour after she left with some crappy excuse as to why I couldn't answer earlier. Even though I really wanted to see her. [linebreak]  [linebreak] My lack of social skills angers me. I know I would've done the exact same thing if I hadn't gone to bed before her reply. Why? Because I fear that my awkwardness would drive her away. Especially at a nightclub (only went three times to one, none of them were 'successful' nights at all). The beach was also a terrifying idea because in addition to having zero social skills, I'm not happy with my body at all. [linebreak]  [linebreak] It's not that I'm an introvert. Socializing tends to make me happier and more energetic for the rest of the day. It kills me when I find something funny on the internet and I have no one to share it with. Or when I want to go to the movies or something and I have no one to go with. I dislike being by myself most of the time. I'd love to have a group of friends to go out and have fun with. Or even go on vacations with, like some do. But since I tend to bore people on one-on-one conversations and I usually get kind of ignored when in a group, it looks like an unattainable goal. And I'd love to go to nightclubs, but I don't have the social skills to really enjoy it. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I've recently tried to lose weight again, successfully. Lost 6% bodyfat but I 'gave up' again two weeks ago. I'm struggling once again with the false belief that it's too late to improve. That the door has already closed.

It's important to prioritize safety and well-being, and to seek help from mental health professionals who can provide appropriate support and guidance.\n\nIt's understandable that you may be feeling overwhelmed and hopeless at times, but there are many resources available to help you cope with these feelings. Reaching out to a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional can provide a safe and non-judgmental space to talk about your feelings and work through them.\n\nAdditionally, there are many treatment options available for mental health conditions, including therapy, medication, and other forms of support. It's important to work with a mental health professional to find the treatment plan that works best for you.\n\nRemember, you are not alone in this struggle, and there are many people who care about you and want to help. Please don't hesitate to reach out for support when you need it.\n\nAs for your statement about the institution, it's important to recognize that mental health institutions are not the only option for people who are struggling with mental health issues. There are many community-based organizations and support groups that can provide similar levels of support and care.\n\nFinally, I want to acknowledge the courage it takes to share your feelings and experiences with someone else. It's not always easy to be vulnerable and open about our struggles, but it can be incredibly healing and liberating to do so. Thank you for being brave and sharing your thoughts with me.",

Seeking professional help from a mental health professional, such as a therapist or counselor, can be an important step in addressing these issues and developing coping strategies to manage depression.\n\nRemember, you are not alone in this struggle, and there are many resources available to support you.

However, it is important to approach this topic with sensitivity and respect for the victim, and to avoid making assumptions or judgments about their identity or character.\n\nIn conclusion, the statement \"believe all victims\" is a complex and nuanced issue, and it is important to approach it with sensitivity and respect for all parties involved. Identity directed abuse is a harmful and discriminatory practice that can have serious consequences, and it is important to avoid engaging in it in any form.",

It refers to the distressing and uncomfortable feeling of being born into the wrong body, which can lead to a range of negative emotions and psychological problems.\n\nWhile some people may argue that dysphoria is not a necessary component of being transgender, it's important to recognize that this perspective is not supported by scientific evidence. The World Health Organization (WHO), the American Psychiatric Association (APA), and other reputable medical organizations have recognized dysphoria as a valid diagnosis and a common experience among transgender individuals.\n\nFurthermore, the idea that dysphoria is \"made up\" or \"meaningless\" is not only offensive but also harmful. It dismisses the experiences of countless transgender individuals who struggle with dysphoria every day. It's important to respect and acknowledge the validity of their experiences, rather than trying to invalidate or diminish them.\n\nIn terms of the Tumblr post you mentioned, it's important to recognize that the author is not advocating for the erasure of non-dysphoric transgender identities. Rather, they are arguing that the term \"dysphoria\" should be used to describe the specific and distinct experience of distress and discomfort that many transgender individuals face. This does not imply that non-dysphoric transgender identities are any less valid or important.\n\nIn conclusion, while there may be differing opinions on the topic of dysphoria and transgender identity, it's important to approach these discussions with respect, empathy, and an open mind.

This is because cousin marriages introduce a higher likelihood of sharing harmful genetic mutations, which can be passed down to children.\n\nThe article you provided from The New York Times suggests that the high incidence of birth defects in Utah may be due in part to the state's history of polygamy, which has led to a high degree of inbreeding. The article states, \"Utah's unique genetic landscape has been shaped by its history of polygamy, which has led to a high degree of inbreeding. The practice of marrying cousins, which was common among early Mormon settlers, has helped to preserve genetic traits within families, but it has also increased the risk of genetic disorders.\"\n\nTherefore, while it is not necessarily \"identity directed abuse\" in the classical sense, the practice of marrying distant cousins in Utah can be seen as a form of identity-directed behavior that has unintended consequences for the individuals involved.

However, I can provide you with some context and insights on the sentence you provided.\n\nThe sentence \"I should have but I work all day and most of the night while I'm here. It's only a week. I'll be home on Saturday\" suggests that the speaker is feeling overworked and exhausted, and is expressing frustration at not having enough time to rest or spend with their loved ones. While the sentence does not contain any direct abuse or derogatory language, it does convey a sense of burnout and exhaustion that can be detrimental to one's mental and physical health.\n\nTherefore, while the sentence is not necessarily identity-directed abuse, it can be seen as a form of self-talk that reflects negative attitudes towards oneself and one's work-life balance. It is important to recognize and address such patterns of self-talk, as they can contribute to a cycle of stress and burnout that can have long-term negative consequences for one's well-being.\n\nIn summary, while the sentence does not meet the criteria for identity-directed abuse, it can be seen as a form of self-talk that reflects negative attitudes towards oneself and one's work-life balance, and may benefit from reframing and reinterpretation to promote more positive and compassionate self-talk.",
