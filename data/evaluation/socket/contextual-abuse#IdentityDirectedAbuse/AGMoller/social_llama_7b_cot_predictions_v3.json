The abuse is not just physical or verbal, but also psychological and emotional, and it has had a lasting impact on the author's sense of self and their ability to trust others.\n\nThe passage also highlights the ways in which the author's experiences have been minimized or dismissed by adults, who have labelled them as \"sensitive\" or \"oversensitive.\" This is a common tactic used by abusers to gaslight and manipulate their victims, and it can have serious consequences for the victim's mental health and well-being.\n\nOverall, the passage suggests that the author has experienced a pattern of identity directed abuse that has had a profound impact on their life and well-being.

There are remakes/remasters that are really good to introduce a new generation to a certain game (Pokémon Fire Red/Leaf Green, The 3DS Zelda remasters), but there is a growing trend of remakes/remasters/complete edtions that are basically just to profit as much as they can off one game without altering it much.

I feel like I've missed out on a lot of things I should've had experienced by now & that it's probably too late to catch up. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Every day is as boring as the previous one. If someone was looking at me all day, all they would see would be some fat guy sitting in front of a gigantic screen with a poker face. [linebreak]  [linebreak] It's sad, man. Every year I feel like it's too late to change, only to regret not having tried one year later. I wish I could go back in time and tell 17 years old me that no, it's not too late to get in shape, as you'll still wish to be ripped when you're 21. Or go back and tell 18 years old me that it is too early to give up any hopes of ever kissing a girl or having a social life. The list goes on. But sadly, I can't change my past. [linebreak]  [linebreak] What's even more depressing is that it is pretty much entirely my fault. Yes, I do have overprotective parents, but I should have done something. If only I had told them to fuck off whenever they asked where I was going, with who, and that endless amount of questions they asked (and still ask) me every time I opened the door, my life could have been a lot more different. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Nowadays, I often act against my own interests solely out of fear. For example: some weeks ago, I messaged a girl I had been texting for around a month (I don't know if I like her as a friend & it's just my mind playing tricks on me because of my inexperience or if I actually like her romantically) at around 3 am and since I didn't get an answer half an hour later I decided to pop some sleeping pills and head to bed. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Right after waking up, I saw her reply. She answered 10 minutes after I knocked myself out. Said she was at some club and told me to drop by if I wanted. A few minutes later, she mentioned that she was going to the beach later if I wanted to go. And that she was leaving the town we both were at at a certain hour. [linebreak]  [linebreak] What did I do? I saw the message an hour before she said she would leave (in the notification panel with my phone in flight mode so she wouldn't know I saw it) and answered an hour after she left with some crappy excuse as to why I couldn't answer earlier. Even though I really wanted to see her. [linebreak]  [linebreak] My lack of social skills angers me. I know I would've done the exact same thing if I hadn't gone to bed before her reply. Why? Because I fear that my awkwardness would drive her away. Especially at a nightclub (only went three times to one, none of them were 'successful' nights at all). The beach was also a terrifying idea because in addition to having zero social skills, I'm not happy with my body at all. [linebreak]  [linebreak] It's not that I'm an introvert. Socializing tends to make me happier and more energetic for the rest of the day. It kills me when I find something funny on the internet and I have no one to share it with. Or when I want to go to the movies or something and I have no one to go with. I dislike being by myself most of the time. I'd love to have a group of friends to go out and have fun with. Or even go on vacations with, like some do. But since I tend to bore people on one-on-one conversations and I usually get kind of ignored when in a group, it looks like an unattainable goal. And I'd love to go to nightclubs, but I don't have the social skills to really enjoy it. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I've recently tried to lose weight again, successfully. Lost 6% bodyfat but I 'gave up' again two weeks ago. I'm struggling once again with the false belief that it's too late to improve. That the door has already closed.

        "prediction": "  Thank you for sharing your thoughts on this topic. I understand that you are concerned about the use of the term \"dysphoria\" in the context of transgender identity, and I appreciate your desire to be respectful and honest.\n\nFirstly, I would like to acknowledge that the term \"dysphoria\" has been used in various ways, including in a non-medical sense to describe the feeling of being emotionally and psychologically aligned with a gender that does not align with one's biological sex. However, it is important to recognize that this term has been historically associated with medical and psychological frameworks, which have been criticized for their limitations and potential harm.\n\nRegarding your points:\n\n1. While it is true that the term \"dysphoria\" has been used in a broader sense, it is important to recognize that this usage can be problematic, as it can perpetuate harmful gender stereotypes and reinforce the idea that there is only one \"correct\" way to experience gender.\n2. You are correct that the term \"transgender\" can be seen as encompassing a range of identities and experiences, including those who do not experience dysphoria. However, it is important to recognize that this does not make the term \"dysphoria\" meaningless, as it can still be a valid and important term for those who do experience it.\n3. I understand your concern that using the term \"dysphoria\" to describe a range of gender experiences could lead to confusion and dilution of the term. However, it is important to recognize that language and terminology are constantly evolving, and it is possible to use language that is inclusive and respectful while still acknowledging the complexity of gender experiences.\n4. I appreciate your point that some transphobic arguments may rely on the idea that gender is a feeling rather than a mental state. However, it is important to recognize that this argument is not only transphobic but also based on a flawed understanding of gender and its relationship to identity.\n5. I understand your question about whether non-dysphoric transgenderism is a form of cultural appropriation. However, I would argue that transgender identity is not a cultural construct, but rather a complex and multifaceted aspect of human identity. While it is important to be respectful of cultural differences and to avoid appropriation, it is also important to recognize that transgender identity is not something that can be \"appropriated\" or reduced to a simple label.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are valid concerns about the use of the term \"dysphoria\" in the context of transgender identity, it is important to recognize that language and terminology are constantly evolving, and it is possible to use language that is inclusive and respectful while still acknowledging the complexity of gender experiences.",

        "prediction": "  Hello! I'm here to help you with your questions. I understand that you're looking for information on a specific topic, and I'll do my best to provide you with accurate and helpful responses.\n\nRegarding your first question, it's important to note that the reason given for a ban on a subreddit is not always the only reason. Moderators have the discretion to ban users based on a variety of factors, including their behavior, the content they post, and the rules of the subreddit. It's possible that the user was banned for multiple reasons, and it's important to respect the moderators' decision and abide by the rules of the subreddit.\n\nIn regards to your second question, it's understandable that you might find it frustrating when moderators don't respond to users in a timely or respectful manner. However, it's important to remember that moderators are volunteers who do their best to manage the subreddit and enforce its rules. They may not always be able to respond to every comment or message, but they are working to maintain a positive and respectful community.\n\nRegarding your third question, it's not appropriate or respectful to make personal attacks or use offensive language towards moderators or any other users. Moderators are volunteers who are working to maintain a positive and respectful community, and they deserve to be treated with respect and dignity. If you have a concern or issue with a moderator's behavior, it's important to address it in a respectful and constructive manner.\n\nIn regards to your fourth question, it's important to remember that moderators are human beings and deserve to be treated with respect and dignity. While it's understandable that you might be frustrated with their behavior, it's not productive or respectful to make personal attacks or use offensive language towards them. If you have a concern or issue with a moderator's behavior, it's important to address it in a respectful and constructive manner.\n\nFinally, regarding your fifth question, it's important to remember that the rules of a subreddit are in place to maintain a positive and respectful community. While it's understandable that you might find some of the rules to be restrictive or unfair, it's important to respect the moderators' decision and abide by the rules of the subreddit.\n\nI hope this helps to clarify things.

        "prediction": "  Thank you for sharing your thoughts on the topic of incest. I can understand why you might have concerns about the potential health risks associated with it, and I appreciate your desire to approach the issue in a respectful and thoughtful manner.\n\nTo address your question, I don't think it's accurate to say that incest is only harmful because of the power imbalances that can exist between relatives of similar ages. While it's true that power imbalances can be a problem in any relationship, the issue with incest is more complex and involves a range of factors.\n\nFirstly, incestuous relationships increase the risk of genetic disorders and health problems in offspring due to the increased chance of inheriting harmful genetic mutations. This is a concern that applies to all instances of incest, regardless of the age or power dynamic between the parties involved.\n\nSecondly, incest can create social and cultural problems, such as the isolation and stigmatization of individuals who engage in such relationships. This can lead to feelings of shame, guilt, and marginalization, which can have negative impacts on mental health and well-being.\n\nFinally, it's worth considering the broader social and cultural context in which incest occurs. In some societies, incest is more common and accepted than in others, and this can have implications for the way in which the practice is viewed and regulated.\n\nIn terms of your question about whether the movie you mentioned is an example of identity-directed abuse, I would say that it is not. Identity-directed abuse refers to situations in which an individual is targeted or mistreated based on their identity, such as their race, gender, or sexual orientation. While the movie may be criticized for its poor production values or offensive content, it is not an example of identity-directed abuse.\n\nI hope this helps to address your questions and concerns.
