But since most people keep buying these, companies have realized they can have more profit with half the work by remaking, remastering and re-releasing these games with special edition instead of focusing on other, different projects. This is what gives us stuff like Pokémon Let's Go, which were considered very lackluster remakes with less effort put in them than the remakes that were released over ten years before and what also makes us buy games that are no more than beta versions, since DLC/complete versions come out the year later. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I am not trying to attack eventual posters that identify with this mindset I am disagreeing with. There are remakes/remasters that are really good to introduce a new generation to a certain game (Pokémon Fire Red/Leaf Green, The 3DS Zelda remasters), but there is a growing trend of remakes/remasters/complete edtions that are basically just to profit as much as they can off one game without altering it much.

I feel like I've missed out on a lot of things I should've had experienced by now & that it's probably too late to catch up. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Every day is as boring as the previous one. If someone was looking at me all day, all they would see would be some fat guy sitting in front of a gigantic screen with a poker face. [linebreak]  [linebreak] It's sad, man. Every year I feel like it's too late to change, only to regret not having tried one year later. I wish I could go back in time and tell 17 years old me that no, it's not too late to get in shape, as you'll still wish to be ripped when you're 21. Or go back and tell 18 years old me that it is too early to give up any hopes of ever kissing a girl or having a social life. The list goes on. But sadly, I can't change my past. [linebreak]  [linebreak] What's even more depressing is that it is pretty much entirely my fault. Yes, I do have overprotective parents, but I should have done something. If only I had told them to fuck off whenever they asked where I was going, with who, and that endless amount of questions they asked (and still ask) me every time I opened the door, my life could have been a lot more different. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Nowadays, I often act against my own interests solely out of fear. For example: some weeks ago, I messaged a girl I had been texting for around a month (I don't know if I like her as a friend & it's just my mind playing tricks on me because of my inexperience or if I actually like her romantically) at around 3 am and since I didn't get an answer half an hour later I decided to pop some sleeping pills and head to bed. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Right after waking up, I saw her reply. She answered 10 minutes after I knocked myself out. Said she was at some club and told me to drop by if I wanted. A few minutes later, she mentioned that she was going to the beach later if I wanted to go. And that she was leaving the town we both were at at a certain hour. [linebreak]  [linebreak] What did I do? I saw the message an hour before she said she would leave (in the notification panel with my phone in flight mode so she wouldn't know I saw it) and answered an hour after she left with some crappy excuse as to why I couldn't answer earlier. Even though I really wanted to see her. [linebreak]  [linebreak] My lack of social skills angers me. I know I would've done the exact same thing if I hadn't gone to bed before her reply. Why? Because I fear that my awkwardness would drive her away. Especially at a nightclub (only went three times to one, none of them were 'successful' nights at all). The beach was also a terrifying idea because in addition to having zero social skills, I'm not happy with my body at all. [linebreak]  [linebreak] It's not that I'm an introvert. Socializing tends to make me happier and more energetic for the rest of the day. It kills me when I find something funny on the internet and I have no one to share it with. Or when I want to go to the movies or something and I have no one to go with. I dislike being by myself most of the time. I'd love to have a group of friends to go out and have fun with. Or even go on vacations with, like some do. But since I tend to bore people on one-on-one conversations and I usually get kind of ignored when in a group, it looks like an unattainable goal. And I'd love to go to nightclubs, but I don't have the social skills to really enjoy it. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I've recently tried to lose weight again, successfully. Lost 6% bodyfat but I 'gave up' again two weeks ago. I'm struggling once again with the false belief that it's too late to improve. That the door has already closed.

It takes a lot of courage to be vulnerable and open up about one's struggles, and I commend you for that.\n\nBased on the content you provided, I would classify this as identity-directed abuse. The language used in your text suggests that you have been subject to negative statements and beliefs about your identity, particularly your gender, sexuality, and body. The constant self-doubt, fear of rejection, and feelings of inadequacy are all common experiences for individuals who have been targeted by identity-directed abuse.\n\nIt's important to recognize that these negative beliefs and feelings are not your fault. You did not ask for or deserve to be subjected to this kind of abuse, and it is not a reflection of your worth as a person.\n\nRemember that you are not alone in this struggle.

Consider reaching out to a mental health professional or a support group for individuals who have experienced identity-directed abuse.\n\nIn the meantime, here are some strategies that may help you cope with these feelings:\n\n1. Practice self-compassion: Be kind and understanding towards yourself, and try to reframe negative beliefs and thoughts.\n2. Challenge harmful beliefs: When you notice negative beliefs or thoughts, try to challenge them by asking yourself if they are based on facts or if they are just assumptions.\n3. Focus on your strengths: Rather than dwelling on your perceived weaknesses, try to focus on your strengths and the things that make you unique and valuable.\n4. Set small goals: Break down larger goals into smaller, achievable steps. This can help you build confidence and a sense of accomplishment.\n5. Seek support: Reach out to friends, family, or a support group for help and encouragement.\n\nRemember, it is never too late to make positive changes in your life.

These reasons do not target any particular identity or group of people, and therefore do not constitute identity-directed abuse.\n\nIt's important to recognize that everyone has the right to choose how they want to engage with others online, and it's not always necessary or appropriate to thank someone for their advice.

By using the term \"50 year olds,\" the sentence targets a specific age group and implies that they are somehow less worthy or less valuable than other age groups. This is a harmful and disrespectful attitude towards individuals based on their age, and it falls under the category of identity directed abuse.\n\nTherefore, I would label the sentence as \"identity directed abuse.\"",
