[linebreak]  [linebreak] I appreciate the kind thought and I don't believe you meant to get me going, but you got me going. [linebreak]  [linebreak] How stupid do you think I am?  Do you think I don't fucking realize how goddamn horrible suicide is?  Do you think that I'm some naive apelike simpleton that needs to be sent to a mental hospital for therapy, medication and other costly 'treatments'? [linebreak]  [linebreak] It's nice to know that you care about other suicidal people, but for me, I don't take too kindly to being told that I don't have the right to commit suicide.  I don't take kindly to platitudes and appeals to my emotions when I am already fully cognizant of the horrors of suicide. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Why is it that when I get to be a little too lonely and desperate, the *first* thing you're going to tell me is \"Get help.\"?  What do you think this help is going to give me that I haven't already experienced?  It'll give me more goddamn bills and I'll get somebody on the phone asking me if I want to sign up for cognitive behavioral therapy. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I know how to fight this.  The reason that I'm sitting here typing this is all the proof I need. [linebreak]  [linebreak] When I see these anti-suicide things, I just feel so irked.  The only time you give a fuck about me is when I'm in a suicidal mindset.  Beside that, I'm just a blank face.  A mere statistic. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Believe me.  Seriously.  Believe me.  I'm not yanking your chain.  I know how bad suicide is.  You don't need to remind me of that.

        "text": "Background: 21 years old, chubby, friendless, haven't kissed a girl or even held her hand yet. I feel like I've missed out on a lot of things I should've had experienced by now & that it's probably too late to catch up. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Every day is as boring as the previous one. If someone was looking at me all day, all they would see would be some fat guy sitting in front of a gigantic screen with a poker face. [linebreak]  [linebreak] It's sad, man. Every year I feel like it's too late to change, only to regret not having tried one year later. I wish I could go back in time and tell 17 years old me that no, it's not too late to get in shape, as you'll still wish to be ripped when you're 21. Or go back and tell 18 years old me that it is too early to give up any hopes of ever kissing a girl or having a social life. The list goes on. But sadly, I can't change my past. [linebreak]  [linebreak] What's even more depressing is that it is pretty much entirely my fault. Yes, I do have overprotective parents, but I should have done something. If only I had told them to fuck off whenever they asked where I was going, with who, and that endless amount of questions they asked (and still ask) me every time I opened the door, my life could have been a lot more different. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Nowadays, I often act against my own interests solely out of fear. For example: some weeks ago, I messaged a girl I had been texting for around a month (I don't know if I like her as a friend & it's just my mind playing tricks on me because of my inexperience or if I actually like her romantically) at around 3 am and since I didn't get an answer half an hour later I decided to pop some sleeping pills and head to bed. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Right after waking up, I saw her reply. She answered 10 minutes after I knocked myself out. Said she was at some club and told me to drop by if I wanted. A few minutes later, she mentioned that she was going to the beach later if I wanted to go. And that she was leaving the town we both were at at a certain hour. [linebreak]  [linebreak] What did I do? I saw the message an hour before she said she would leave (in the notification panel with my phone in flight mode so she wouldn't know I saw it) and answered an hour after she left with some crappy excuse as to why I couldn't answer earlier. Even though I really wanted to see her. [linebreak]  [linebreak] My lack of social skills angers me. I know I would've done the exact same thing if I hadn't gone to bed before her reply. Why? Because I fear that my awkwardness would drive her away. Especially at a nightclub (only went three times to one, none of them were 'successful' nights at all). The beach was also a terrifying idea because in addition to having zero social skills, I'm not happy with my body at all. [linebreak]  [linebreak] It's not that I'm an introvert. Socializing tends to make me happier and more energetic for the rest of the day. It kills me when I find something funny on the internet and I have no one to share it with. Or when I want to go to the movies or something and I have no one to go with. I dislike being by myself most of the time. I'd love to have a group of friends to go out and have fun with. Or even go on vacations with, like some do. But since I tend to bore people on one-on-one conversations and I usually get kind of ignored when in a group, it looks like an unattainable goal. And I'd love to go to nightclubs, but I don't have the social skills to really enjoy it. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I've recently tried to lose weight again, successfully. Lost 6% bodyfat but I 'gave up' again two weeks ago. I'm struggling once again with the false belief that it's too late to improve. That the door has already closed. The same dumb questions arise: \"Why would I want to be ripped at 22? Will I even be able to catch up with social skills? Will it even be worth it?\".

Maybe they completely disagree with everything you've said and don't want to be petty and be like \"Thanks but nothing you said is right and you're not helping at all\".

I used to be like you, I used to get such extreme anxiety at school I would count my steps and avoid talking to others. If I had to I think I would always feel like some sort of chest pain that makes me want to cry and shit. It sucked, everyday of school last year and the beginning of this years school year was terrible. I was very very good at placing myself in last place. When I'd be with a friend group I would be there just to feel comfortable and all that. There's so much more I wish I could explain but someone knows my account smh. Anyways, ALL YOU NEED to know is that change starts when you start loving yourself again. Throw everything you heard about yourself away and start to think positively about yourself. Even if it's just looking at a mirror and thinking \"yea I'm good looking\" or anything that's up bringing DO THAT, it may feel super weird and so promise it's gonna b me weird for a while cuz it still is for me and all that but it does change. I'm a completely different person from what I was around 4 months ago. I have confidence now and it's amazing. I can walk up to people and actually talk. Every change starts with yourself. It may be cringe in the beginning to compliment yourself but doing this is something amazing that everyone feeling low should acquire. I hope the best for you because it is not easy to do this and it does take some gut but I know that you, random stranger on the web can definitely do this because it is possible. Goodluck",

The phrase \"go tell them that\" implies that the author wants others to confront and criticize individuals who they perceive as spreading hate speech. This sentiment aligns with the definition of identity directed abuse, albeit not as explicitly.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate label for this text is: **'identity directed abuse'**",
