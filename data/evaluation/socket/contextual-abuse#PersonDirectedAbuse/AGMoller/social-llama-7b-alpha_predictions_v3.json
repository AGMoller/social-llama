This is what gives us stuff like Pokémon Let's Go, which were considered very lackluster remakes with less effort put in them than the remakes that were released over ten years before and what also makes us buy games that are no more than beta versions, since DLC/complete versions come out the year later. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I am not trying to attack eventual posters that identify with this mindset I am disagreeing with. There are remakes/remasters that are really good to introduce a new generation to a certain game (Pokémon Fire Red/Leaf Green, The 3DS Zelda remasters), but there is a growing trend of remakes/remasters/complete edtions that are basically just to profit as much as they can off one game without altering it much.

I feel like I've missed out on a lot of things I should've had experienced by now & that it's probably too late to catch up. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Every day is as boring as the previous one. If someone was looking at me all day, all they would see would be some fat guy sitting in front of a gigantic screen with a poker face. [linebreak]  [linebreak] It's sad, man. Every year I feel like it's too late to change, only to regret not having tried one year later. I wish I could go back in time and tell 17 years old me that no, it's not too late to get in shape, as you'll still wish to be ripped when you're 21. Or go back and tell 18 years old me that it is too early to give up any hopes of ever kissing a girl or having a social life. The list goes on. But sadly, I can't change my past. [linebreak]  [linebreak] What's even more depressing is that it is pretty much entirely my fault. Yes, I do have overprotective parents, but I should have done something. If only I had told them to fuck off whenever they asked where I was going, with who, and that endless amount of questions they asked (and still ask) me every time I opened the door, my life could have been a lot more different. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Nowadays, I often act against my own interests solely out of fear. For example: some weeks ago, I messaged a girl I had been texting for around a month (I don't know if I like her as a friend & it's just my mind playing tricks on me because of my inexperience or if I actually like her romantically) at around 3 am and since I didn't get an answer half an hour later I decided to pop some sleeping pills and head to bed. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Right after waking up, I saw her reply. She answered 10 minutes after I knocked myself out. Said she was at some club and told me to drop by if I wanted. A few minutes later, she mentioned that she was going to the beach later if I wanted to go. And that she was leaving the town we both were at at a certain hour. [linebreak]  [linebreak] What did I do? I saw the message an hour before she said she would leave (in the notification panel with my phone in flight mode so she wouldn't know I saw it) and answered an hour after she left with some crappy excuse as to why I couldn't answer earlier. Even though I really wanted to see her. [linebreak]  [linebreak] My lack of social skills angers me. I know I would've done the exact same thing if I hadn't gone to bed before her reply. Why? Because I fear that my awkwardness would drive her away. Especially at a nightclub (only went three times to one, none of them were 'successful' nights at all). The beach was also a terrifying idea because in addition to having zero social skills, I'm not happy with my body at all. [linebreak]  [linebreak] It's not that I'm an introvert. Socializing tends to make me happier and more energetic for the rest of the day. It kills me when I find something funny on the internet and I have no one to share it with. Or when I want to go to the movies or something and I have no one to go with. I dislike being by myself most of the time. I'd love to have a group of friends to go out and have fun with. Or even go on vacations with, like some do. But since I tend to bore people on one-on-one conversations and I usually get kind of ignored when in a group, it looks like an unattainable goal.

Additionally, the assumption that someone cannot cook pasta based on their ethnicity is also offensive and not grounded in fact.

However, it is important to acknowledge that this definition is intended to provide a more inclusive and respectful understanding of the term, rather than making it meaningless.\n\nIn response to your fourth point, it is true that some transphobic arguments may argue that gender is unrelated to how an individual feels.

The idea that a man can be \"persuaded\" or \"tricked\" into sexual activity without their consent is not only problematic but also reinforces harmful attitudes towards sexual assault.\n\nThe term \"person directed abuse\" is not applicable in this context, as it implies that the abuse is intentional and deliberate.

        "prediction": "  I would label the sentence as \"person directed abuse.\"\n\nThe sentence contains language that is intended to be supportive and uplifting, but it also contains some red flags that suggest it may be abusive. Here are some reasons why:\n\n1. Overly positive and unrealistic expectations: The sentence promises that \"change starts when you start loving yourself again\" and that \"every change starts with yourself.\" While it's important to have positive self-talk and self-esteem, it's not always possible to change one's circumstances or feelings overnight, and it's unrealistic to expect that doing so will be easy or straightforward.\n2. Lack of empathy or understanding: The sentence assumes that the reader is struggling with low self-esteem or confidence, and offers a solution without acknowledging the complexity of the issue or the potential challenges the reader may face in implementing the suggested changes.\n3. Unqualified advice: The sentence offers advice on how to improve one's self-esteem and confidence, but it does not provide any evidence or qualifications to support the advice. It's important to seek advice from qualified professionals or individuals who have experience in the area they are advising on.\n4. Pressure to change: The sentence creates a sense of urgency and pressure to change, using phrases like \"it may be cringe in the beginning\" and \"it does take some guts.\" While it's important to be motivated and committed to making changes, it's also important to approach these changes in a gradual and sustainable way.\n\nOverall, while the sentence may be well-intentioned, it contains some language and tone that could be perceived as abusive or manipulative. It's important to be mindful of these potential red flags when offering advice or support to others.",
