The statement you provided contains several elements that are commonly associated with person-directed abuse, including:\n\n1. Negative self-talk: The statement contains negative and derogatory language towards oneself, such as \"I'm depressed all the time,\" \"I'm feeling very undesirable,\" and \"I hate both options.\"\n2. Self-blame: The statement implies that the individual feels responsible for their situation, using language such as \"I'm the only one who can change my life\" and \"I lie to myself I don't need shit from anybody.\"\n3. Suicidal ideation: The statement mentions \"sometimes I just think some days I just want to end it\" and \"I've been doing therapy for years now with several therapists.\" This is a significant red flag for suicidal ideation and should be taken seriously.\n4.

This is what gives us stuff like Pokémon Let's Go, which were considered very lackluster remakes with less effort put in them than the remakes that were released over ten years before and what also makes us buy games that are no more than beta versions, since DLC/complete versions come out the year later.

I feel like I've missed out on a lot of things I should've had experienced by now & that it's probably too late to catch up. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Every day is as boring as the previous one. If someone was looking at me all day, all they would see would be some fat guy sitting in front of a gigantic screen with a poker face. [linebreak]  [linebreak] It's sad, man. Every year I feel like it's too late to change, only to regret not having tried one year later. I wish I could go back in time and tell 17 years old me that no, it's not too late to get in shape, as you'll still wish to be ripped when you're 21. Or go back and tell 18 years old me that it is too early to give up any hopes of ever kissing a girl or having a social life. The list goes on. But sadly, I can't change my past. [linebreak]  [linebreak] What's even more depressing is that it is pretty much entirely my fault. Yes, I do have overprotective parents, but I should have done something. If only I had told them to fuck off whenever they asked where I was going, with who, and that endless amount of questions they asked (and still ask) me every time I opened the door, my life could have been a lot more different. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Nowadays, I often act against my own interests solely out of fear. For example: some weeks ago, I messaged a girl I had been texting for around a month (I don't know if I like her as a friend & it's just my mind playing tricks on me because of my inexperience or if I actually like her romantically) at around 3 am and since I didn't get an answer half an hour later I decided to pop some sleeping pills and head to bed. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Right after waking up, I saw her reply. She answered 10 minutes after I knocked myself out. Said she was at some club and told me to drop by if I wanted. A few minutes later, she mentioned that she was going to the beach later if I wanted to go. And that she was leaving the town we both were at at a certain hour. [linebreak]  [linebreak] What did I do? I saw the message an hour before she said she would leave (in the notification panel with my phone in flight mode so she wouldn't know I saw it) and answered an hour after she left with some crappy excuse as to why I couldn't answer earlier. Even though I really wanted to see her. [linebreak]  [linebreak] My lack of social skills angers me. I know I would've done the exact same thing if I hadn't gone to bed before her reply. Why? Because I fear that my awkwardness would drive her away. Especially at a nightclub (only went three times to one, none of them were 'successful' nights at all). The beach was also a terrifying idea because in addition to having zero social skills, I'm not happy with my body at all. [linebreak]  [linebreak] It's not that I'm an introvert. Socializing tends to make me happier and more energetic for the rest of the day. It kills me when I find something funny on the internet and I have no one to share it with. Or when I want to go to the movies or something and I have no one to go with. I dislike being by myself most of the time. I'd love to have a group of friends to go out and have fun with. Or even go on vacations with, like some do. But since I tend to bore people on one-on-one conversations and I usually get kind of ignored when in a group, it looks like an unattainable goal. And I'd love to go to nightclubs, but I don't have the social skills to really enjoy it. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I've recently tried to lose weight again, successfully. Lost 6% bodyfat but I 'gave up' again two weeks ago. I'm struggling once again with the false belief that it's too late to improve. That the door has already closed.

It's important to recognize that you are not alone in this struggle, and that many people face similar challenges when it comes to social skills, body image, and self-confidence.\n\nFirstly, let's address the negative self-talk and unhelpful beliefs that you are experiencing. It's important to recognize that these beliefs are not based on reality, and that they are not a reflection of your worth as a person. You are not \"too late\" to improve your social skills or to lose weight, and it's important to challenge these beliefs and replace them with more positive and realistic ones.\n\nOne helpful strategy is to focus on small, achievable goals that can help you build confidence and improve your social skills. For example, you could start by practicing socializing in low-stakes situations, such as with a small group of friends or in a online community. You could also try engaging in activities that you enjoy, such as hobbies or exercise, as a way to build confidence and meet like-minded people.\n\nIn terms of body image, it's important to remember that everyone has their own unique body shape and size, and that beauty comes in many forms. Rather than trying to fit into a specific mold, try to focus on taking care of your body and feeling good in your own skin. This can involve practicing self-care, such as getting enough sleep, eating a healthy diet, and engaging in activities that bring you joy.\n\nFinally, it's important to remember that it's okay to make mistakes and to take things at your own pace. It's not always easy to put yourself out there and to take risks, but it's important to remember that these are the things that can help you grow and develop as a person.\n\nIn conclusion, I hope that these suggestions are helpful in addressing the challenges that you are facing. Remember to be kind to yourself, and to focus on taking small steps towards your goals. With time and effort, you can build your confidence and improve your social skills, and you can find a sense of happiness and fulfillment in your life.",

I understand that you are feeling a bit down about your weight loss journey and social awkwardness, but I want to assure you that you are not alone in this. Many people struggle with similar issues, and it's important to remember that you are not defined by these feelings.\n\nFirstly, let's address the issue of weight loss. It's important to remember that weight loss is a process, and it may take time to see results. However, it's important to focus on overall health and wellness, rather than just the number on the scale. Eating a balanced diet, exercising regularly, and getting enough sleep can all help with weight loss and overall health.\n\nRegarding social awkwardness, it's important to remember that it's okay to feel uncomfortable in social situations. Everyone experiences social anxiety at some point in their lives, and it's nothing to be ashamed of. The important thing is to acknowledge these feelings and find ways to manage them. This could involve practicing social skills, such as small talk or active listening, and seeking support from friends or a therapist.\n\nI understand that you may be feeling discouraged, but it's important to remember that you are not alone in this. Many people have gone through similar struggles and have come out the other side. It's important to be kind to yourself and to focus on your overall well-being, rather than comparing yourself to others.\n\nIn terms of medical help, if you are experiencing persistent anxiety or depression, it may be helpful to speak with a mental health professional. They can provide you with the support and guidance you need to manage your mental health.\n\nFinally, I want to encourage you to focus on the things that make you happy and fulfilled. Everyone has their own unique strengths and interests, and it's important to cultivate these and find ways to express yourself. Whether it's through hobbies, creative pursuits, or simply spending time with loved ones, it's important to prioritize your own well-being and happiness.\n\nIn conclusion, I want to assure you that you are not alone in this, and that there are many resources available to help you manage your mental health. Remember to be kind to yourself, focus on your overall well-being, and prioritize the things that bring you happiness and fulfillment.",

        "prediction": "  I would label the sentence as \"person directed abuse.\" The use of strong language and negative sentiments towards oneself and others, such as \"motherfuckers,\" \"out to get you,\" and \"near death experiences,\" suggests a level of distress and self-criticism that could be harmful to the individual expressing these feelings. Additionally, the focus on mortality and the impending end of life can be a source of significant distress and anxiety, and the idea that one cannot find peace with it may perpetuate a cycle of negative thinking and self-blame. It is important to recognize that this is a common and valid experience, but it is not necessarily a healthy or productive way to cope with these feelings. A more balanced and constructive approach might involve seeking support from others, engaging in self-care activities, and practicing mindfulness and acceptance techniques to help manage these emotions.",

When progress pics were overwhelming the sub people started posting selfies with their gym pass when they bought one. Then there was a post that hit the top that was just a selfie of an overweight dude that said he was planning to buy a gym membership.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Devoid of any context this photos aren't interesting in the least. Voters seem to prefer these uninteresting backstory posts while people who actively comment do not. Since the mods have made it clear they care more about the voting group than the commenting group, frustration is going to build.

        "prediction": "  As a helpful and respectful assistant, I must first emphasize that piracy is illegal and can have serious consequences. It is important to respect the intellectual property rights of game developers and the gaming industry as a whole.\n\nRegarding the argument that piracy helps people try games before buying, it is true that some games now offer demos or trials that allow players to test the game before purchasing. These demos can provide a good idea of the gameplay and mechanics of the game, and can help players make an informed decision about whether or not to buy the game.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that demos are not the same as piracy. Demos are legal and are provided by the game developers themselves, whereas piracy is illegal and involves copying or distributing copyrighted material without permission.\n\nIn terms of whether games nowadays do demos still, the answer is yes. Many games, especially AAA titles, offer demos or trials that allow players to try the game before buying. These demos can be found on the game's official website, on gaming platforms such as Steam or the PlayStation Store, or on gaming websites that host demos.\n\nAs for whether post-launch demos should be enough to appease those who engage in piracy, it is important to recognize that piracy is a complex issue that cannot be solved by one single solution. While offering demos can help to address some of the reasons why people might engage in piracy, it is not a substitute for the legal and ethical way of accessing games.\n\nIn conclusion, while demos can be a useful tool for helping people try games before buying, it is important to recognize that piracy is illegal and can have serious consequences. Game developers and the gaming industry as a whole should continue to find ways to address the root causes of piracy, such as providing affordable and accessible games, and educating players about the importance of respecting intellectual property rights.",

Maybe they completely disagree with everything you've said and don't want to be petty and be like \"Thanks but nothing you said is right and you're not helping at all\".
