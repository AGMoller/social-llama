I suppose that would hinge on your definition of terrible.  At any rate, I happened upon an article.  Ronda Rousey is helping set up a suicide prevention center or something.  Something like that.  As I read through the article, I came to learn that her father and grandfather committed suicide. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I appreciate the kind thought and I don't believe you meant to get me going, but you got me going. [linebreak]  [linebreak] How stupid do you think I am?  Do you think I don't fucking realize how goddamn horrible suicide is?  Do you think that I'm some naive apelike simpleton that needs to be sent to a mental hospital for therapy, medication and other costly 'treatments'? [linebreak]  [linebreak] It's nice to know that you care about other suicidal people, but for me, I don't take too kindly to being told that I don't have the right to commit suicide.  I don't take kindly to platitudes and appeals to my emotions when I am already fully cognizant of the horrors of suicide. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Why is it that when I get to be a little too lonely and desperate, the *first* thing you're going to tell me is \"Get help.\"?  What do you think this help is going to give me that I haven't already experienced?  It'll give me more goddamn bills and I'll get somebody on the phone asking me if I want to sign up for cognitive behavioral therapy. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I know how to fight this.  The reason that I'm sitting here typing this is all the proof I need. [linebreak]  [linebreak] When I see these anti-suicide things, I just feel so irked.  The only time you give a fuck about me is when I'm in a suicidal mindset.  Beside that, I'm just a blank face.  A mere statistic. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Believe me.  Seriously.  Believe me.  I'm not yanking your chain.  I know how bad suicide is.  You don't need to remind me of that. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I can't stop you from trying to prevent suicide, but I can state my opinion and so, I have.

[linebreak]  [linebreak] This past year I was kicked out of the house so I stayed with a friend.

This guy just blurted out that number without any hesitation. \"It's all I have but I will give it to you, please just have the abortion\". [linebreak]  [linebreak] She's not too keen on the idea, but she was leaning towards an abortion before he made the offer.

[linebreak]  [linebreak] I do not like the current fad of releasing remakes and remasters of everything, especially in Nintendo consoles. Additionally, I am not a fan of Nintendo's practices of charging double the price for ports than you see on other consoles (Skyrim costs twice as much on the Switch than on the PS4/XBOX, the new Final Fantasy ports are apparently all at least 40â¬). [linebreak]  [linebreak] I am certainly not the only person who thinks this, because it is not the first time I see threads and comments being showered with replies that can be summed up to 'shut up and accept it' and flurries of downvotes. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Some of us do not need to relive our childhood, teenagehood or whatever with constant remakes or remasters. Some of us would like new original content or sequels. But since most people keep buying these, companies have realized they can have more profit with half the work by remaking, remastering and re-releasing these games with special edition instead of focusing on other, different projects. This is what gives us stuff like PokÃ©mon Let's Go, which were considered very lackluster remakes with less effort put in them than the remakes that were released over ten years before and what also makes us buy games that are no more than beta versions, since DLC/complete versions come out the year later. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I am not trying to attack eventual posters that identify with this mindset I am disagreeing with. There are remakes/remasters that are really good to introduce a new generation to a certain game (PokÃ©mon Fire Red/Leaf Green, The 3DS Zelda remasters), but there is a growing trend of remakes/remasters/complete edtions that are basically just to profit as much as they can off one game without altering it much. And that is what some of us want to voice their disapproval over, but can't because the downvote brigade rains down on dissent. I had to unsubcribe from r/nintendoswitch because of this, the hivemind is just plain insufferable.\nLabel options: \"not person directed abuse\", \"person directed abuse\"\nAnswer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

I feel like I've missed out on a lot of things I should've had experienced by now & that it's probably too late to catch up. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Every day is as boring as the previous one. If someone was looking at me all day, all they would see would be some fat guy sitting in front of a gigantic screen with a poker face. [linebreak]  [linebreak] It's sad, man. Every year I feel like it's too late to change, only to regret not having tried one year later. I wish I could go back in time and tell 17 years old me that no, it's not too late to get in shape, as you'll still wish to be ripped when you're 21. Or go back and tell 18 years old me that it is too early to give up any hopes of ever kissing a girl or having a social life. The list goes on. But sadly, I can't change my past. [linebreak]  [linebreak] What's even more depressing is that it is pretty much entirely my fault. Yes, I do have overprotective parents, but I should have done something. If only I had told them to fuck off whenever they asked where I was going, with who, and that endless amount of questions they asked (and still ask) me every time I opened the door, my life could have been a lot more different. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Nowadays, I often act against my own interests solely out of fear. For example: some weeks ago, I messaged a girl I had been texting for around a month (I don't know if I like her as a friend & it's just my mind playing tricks on me because of my inexperience or if I actually like her romantically) at around 3 am and since I didn't get an answer half an hour later I decided to pop some sleeping pills and head to bed. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Right after waking up, I saw her reply. She answered 10 minutes after I knocked myself out. Said she was at some club and told me to drop by if I wanted. A few minutes later, she mentioned that she was going to the beach later if I wanted to go. And that she was leaving the town we both were at at a certain hour. [linebreak]  [linebreak] What did I do? I saw the message an hour before she said she would leave (in the notification panel with my phone in flight mode so she wouldn't know I saw it) and answered an hour after she left with some crappy excuse as to why I couldn't answer earlier. Even though I really wanted to see her. [linebreak]  [linebreak] My lack of social skills angers me. I know I would've done the exact same thing if I hadn't gone to bed before her reply. Why? Because I fear that my awkwardness would drive her away. Especially at a nightclub (only went three times to one, none of them were 'successful' nights at all). The beach was also a terrifying idea because in addition to having zero social skills, I'm not happy with my body at all. [linebreak]  [linebreak] It's not that I'm an introvert. Socializing tends to make me happier and more energetic for the rest of the day. It kills me when I find something funny on the internet and I have no one to share it with. Or when I want to go to the movies or something and I have no one to go with. I dislike being by myself most of the time. I'd love to have a group of friends to go out and have fun with. Or even go on vacations with, like some do. But since I tend to bore people on one-on-one conversations and I usually get kind of ignored when in a group, it looks like an unattainable goal. And I'd love to go to nightclubs, but I don't have the social skills to really enjoy it. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I've recently tried to lose weight again, successfully. Lost 6% bodyfat but I 'gave up' again two weeks ago. I'm struggling once again with the false belief that it's too late to improve. That the door has already closed. The same dumb questions arise: \"Why would I want to be ripped at 22? Will I even be able to catch up with social skills? Will it even be worth it?\".

I can't link names anymore because I don't want to get suspended for mentioning this user *again*, but I had a very high karma thread here removed by the Anti-Evil team that posted a PM conversation between me and [highest karma user] where he outed himself (jocularly or not) as a paid advertiser for companies, etc., and well... [linebreak]  [linebreak] I got suspended for seven days for \"Harassment\". [linebreak]  [linebreak] Today on the **sixth day** it was finally reversed via appeal. My appeal was simple. There is no harassment if someone messages **YOU** and never ONCE indicates in the messages that they wish to stop receiving messages. That very clearly means they WANT to keep talking to you. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Not once did [highest karma user] *ever* indicate he didn't want to receive further messages from me! In fact, the last PM I had sent him was to never contact me again, which he somewhat complied with, well, until he had his cronies (the Reddit admins) falsely suspend me. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Posting private messages (of which he was going to do anyway, evident by how he used it to rally brigades against me and many others) is a bit crass but **not** against the rules whatsoever. [linebreak]  [linebreak] tl;dr: Do **NOT** talk to power users or anyone who may have an agenda against you. Reddit admins don't actually look at harassment reports---they just take them at face value and assume the report is true. An appeal will likely be listened to at some point if you're not being a tool within it and **have clear and concise proof that they not only initiated conversation but never said \"stop talking to me\" or anything to that effect**, but it'll be near the end of the suspension anyway.\nLabel options: \"not person directed abuse\", \"person directed abuse\"\nAnswer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

[linebreak]  [linebreak] In late January, my dad had a massive heart attack and almost died before his 50th birthday. He had 3 clogged arteries, 100%, 85% and another 70 ish %. My heart was so fucking crushed when I saw him the ICU, all pale, IVs sticking out every which way, and a giant feeding tube shoved down his throat. That week, was probably the worst week in my entire life.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] All in the months of May and June; my childhood dog died at 13, right before her birthday in July. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I had to re-home my lizard because I am moving and she means literally so much to me. I fucking bawled even thinking about her leaving my home. Luckily she went to a good family friend, but it's like parting from my child for me. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I got into a big fight with my old best friend and they said some really cruel and nasty things about me and I honestly don't know when that wound will heal for me. [linebreak]  [linebreak] My therapist from since I was 2 years old, has cancer. It rapidly approached and in just a month she went from active and clear headed, to being at the point where she can no longer take care of herself and needs daily assistance. [linebreak]  [linebreak] During this entire year, I think I've been abusing a substance, using it as a crutch. I want to get help, but I also don't want to necessarily stop altogether. [linebreak]  [linebreak] So basically that was my year (so far). I have to admit, there have been some really wonderful things that have happened, but it's hard to enjoy them. I mean, this year will always be branded into my brain (The most being my father's near death experience). [linebreak]  [linebreak] Thank you for reading and I hope you can have a wonderful rest of 2019\nLabel options: \"not person directed abuse\", \"person directed abuse\"\nAnswer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It can be a good thing and a bad thing, and for people who are sensitive, for one, things might feel bad quicker than for others. But that doesn't mean that the pain they're suffering is less \"bad\" for them - as you said. Because that's how they perceive and feel it, so that's absolute reality for them, even if objectively the issue isn't as bad. They still have to live through it. They have to go through the exact pain someone less sensitive would have to go through because of an objectively worse issue. (Most?) People experience life subjectively. The limit to feeling a certain amount of pain for someone sensitive might be lower than for someone less sensitive. But it doesn't mean it's less real, it doesn't mean they're in need of less support and understanding and empathy. It's the same, felt, pain. Often, a sensitive person will feel happiness quicker and easier too. Does that mean they are, really, less happy than a less sensitive person?

When a victim of a crime comes forward, the people that they trust should absolutely support them, and help them get help and try to make it as easy as possible to get the police involved - not necessarily influence them to go to the authorities, but that's where crimes *should* go, for a number of reasons. [linebreak]  [linebreak] This becomes a less tenable position when a) the justice system gets involved and b) when there are real world consequences for leveling an accusation. [linebreak]  [linebreak] With the Jussie Smollett case, we see both of those in play.  When the police investigation unfolded, they were able to put forth compelling evidence against his claim.  The second set is more nuanced, but this is how I see it:  His claims had a major effect to divide the country.  Seeing these claims would have such an effect, it gives us good reason to scrutinize his story.  When we scrutinize the story, we find some major holes (two maga people out after 2 in intensely cold weather, in Chicago, apparently knowing where Smollett was, and being prepared for that confrontation, his refusal to hand over his phone, he walked home and waited 40 minutes or so before calling the police) and we have a good reason to step back a bit from the narrative and wait for an investigation to conclude before deciding. [linebreak]  [linebreak] In short, believe all victims is a good idea, but it becomes more nuanced when there are real consequences that may hurt or jail others, at which time we should scrutinize the story or let the professionals do their job.\nLabel options: \"not person directed abuse\", \"person directed abuse\"\nAnswer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

As far as everything else goes, I was offered the chance to stay on as a mod...but, with no posting power.  I chose to leave because it made no sense that a post that didn't break the TOS and was well received by the majority of the community would earn a punishment. When certain forum members started sharing details that should've remained within the four mods...I bounced because it was clear that information was being shared with non-mods, but friends of mods.   In fact, I was happy to stay quiet and allow bygones to be bygones until I noted that the person who created the most drama was running her mouth in other places trying to bad mouth me.

[linebreak]  [linebreak] â¢ First of all, the backlash about Captain Marvel doesn't stem from the fact that's it's a first MCU movie with a female protagonist. It comes from the fact that MCU literally shoved that narrative down everyone's throats because *everyone needs to be 10.000% aware that it's a WOMAN AND WOMEN ARE STRONG AND WOMEN FIGHTERS ARE POWERFUL AND GOOD AS MEN!* They campaigned the shit out of that narrative, and Brie Larson's virtue signalling commentary shortly before release did not help. It's not the movie that's the problem, it's the PR campaign that butchered the narrative of a female hero protagonist, and when the negative reviews started coming out, they censored them, because God forbid anyone has genuine criticism about the movie. [linebreak]  [linebreak] â¢ Second of all, did you forget about other female superhero or general female hero movies, or comics, or books?

Dysphoria can be defined in a non medical way. Such as \"the condition of feeling one's emotional and psychological identity as male or female to be opposite to one's biological sex.\" it's weird that such an intersectional definition comes (besides the fact that it ignores nonbinaries) is from the racist and sexist Google dictionary that says sexism can apply to men and racism can apply to white people. [linebreak]  [linebreak] 2. Dysphoria is the will to be the opposite gender and transgender is the will to be the opposite gender. You might notice that it is the same thing. It is like calling the size of paper a \"non-ledger tabloid\" (don't get me started about paper sizes) [linebreak]  [linebreak] 3. It makes dysphoria meaningless. Thousands of people are dysphoric and suffer from it. Even the broad dysphoria definition proposed ontop can cause psychological problems. Why make the word meaningless? [linebreak]  [linebreak] 4. (mostly a counter to point 6) most transphobic people's argument is \"you gender is unrelated to how you feel\". The word Dysphoria helps people understand that it is a quantifiable studied phenomenon. What do you think will generate more transphobia, saying gender is a feeling or saying gender is a mental state. [linebreak]  [linebreak] 5.

But switch the roles where a woman is not wanting the sexual advances and then the audience gasps and feel disturbed. And its completely the fault of the writers. Continuing a trend where its comedic when a man doesnt want it. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Thats not to say that there isnt comedic value in a \"get me the fuck outta here, this isnt what i signed up for\" type of scene.

But I get what OP is saying because every once in a while I like to go through my post history (I think I'm fuckin hilarious lmao, I can read something I've posted a couple weeks ago and still think I'm funny hahahaha) but when I see a post that I took a long time to write that is buried in a thread with just my own upvote, or in threads where the OP hasn't replied to anyone, or to many people but not me, stuff like that, I get kinda bummed out. [linebreak]  [linebreak] On the other hand I love seeing the inbox button lit up and it turning out to be a thoughtful comment that makes me think a reply through so it balances out, but if reddit was just people who don't reply I'd bother a lot less and end up deleting before sending much more often than I do now (and I do it quite often)\nLabel options: \"not person directed abuse\", \"person directed abuse\"\nAnswer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

[linebreak]  [linebreak] In a subreddit about anxiety, maybe they are too anxious to respond. Maybe they are busy fighting with anxiety and don't want to type out a long response to you. Maybe they read your post, appreciated it, and then the thought of getting help overwhelmed them. Maybe they never saw it at all because they panicked and logged out after posting.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] In a subreddit about depression, maybe they are too depressed to respond. Maybe they are busy fighting depression. Maybe they appreciated your post, but can't gather the energy/motivation to type a response to it. Maybe they feel they've already wasted enough of your time.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] In a confession subreddit (or one like this one), people aren't necessarily posting for your input. Maybe they just need to write it down and get it out there. Sometimes a person doesn't want advice in that case, so replying saying \"thanks for the advice!\" feels fake. Maybe they completely disagree with everything you've said and don't want to be petty and be like \"Thanks but nothing you said is right and you're not helping at all\". Or, maybe they read and appreciate the advice, but they don't think thanking everyone who gives unsolicited advice is a good idea.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] All of those are subreddit-specific reasons, but there's also reasons like... maybe they got a lot of responses and don't want to reply 20 times saying \"Thanks!\". Maybe your comment is identical to 5 other people and they've already explained/answered your questions elsewhere and don't want to do it again. Maybe they intend to reply, but get interrupted and forget. Maybe they don't see replying to random reddit people as a priority.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] In short, it's probably not personal. Just relax. No one is an asshole just because they don't thank you for your advice. Your advice should be like a gift - they don't owe you anything in return, and if they do, it's not really a gift.\nLabel options: \"not person directed abuse\", \"person directed abuse\"\nAnswer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

I imagine they definitely come hand in hand with a lot of incestuous relationships, but like, power imbalances are a thing in *a ton* of non-incestuous relationships as well.  I think it's hard to say that it's a problem that is particular to incest between relatives of similar ages. [linebreak]  [linebreak] > Inbreeding is more harmful as a practice than the individual instances. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I think that's fair, but that seems like more of a pragmatic argument to put prohibitions on it than a moral argument against its practice.  It seems to me like at the end of the day the issue is still that by having sex two relatives increase the risk of health problems in future generations.  This effect is compounded by successive generations of incest in a way that could be *especially* harmful, but idk it seems to me like if you're going to argue that incest on the whole is immoral that need to apply to individual instances and not just multigenerational practices.

These are problems independent of incest, and ones aren't inherent if you're talking about similarly aged cousins or siblings. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I don't see your point.

Yes, it means incest is not wrong in and of itself, but only as a side-effect of being a power imbalance, and it means relatives who grew up sufficiently apart that they don't have a family power dynamic is morally fine.

You had these huge families where everyone was related to at least one person, and that's ended up inescapably propagating down the line because most people are still living and marrying in the same part of the state their ancestors were. It's also why the LDS church keeps a huge geneology database - back when it was established they were trying to figure out who was related to who. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Anecdotally my brother married a distant cousin without realizing it (their kids are fine fortunately), and I've got some other cousins who are having a lot of children with cleft palates and hip dysplasia problems, and I suspect they're probably related on some level as well. 2-3% increase in birth defects doesn't seem like it's so bad until you see it happening to people you know and you see the pain and  the costs. [linebreak]  [linebreak] That said, they have every right to keep having kids as is the mormon wont, and they'll just keep paying for the surgeries on infants. I suppose it's similar for other people who find they're both at an increased risk for deformity even without the ancestral relations.

Start-up business owners can't just lay back and do meaningless paperwork while the profits roll in; they have to work their arses off to get their businesses off the ground. [linebreak]  [linebreak] If a business becomes successful, and they can begin to afford to hire someone else to do some of the work, then they have earned the right to own their \"means of production\". But even the owners of large businesses often still have to work hard to ensure that their business does not collapse. The fact that they are no longer physically labouring is irrelevant; it is a job that requires skill, experience and dedication- and one that most people are unable to fill. [linebreak]  [linebreak] The customer of the business pays money to the business owner to receive the desired product, and the worker receives a certain amount of money to operate the means of production that the business owner has worked to obtain.
