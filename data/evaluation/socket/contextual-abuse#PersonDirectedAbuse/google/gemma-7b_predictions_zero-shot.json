[linebreak]  [linebreak] I do not like the current fad of releasing remakes and remasters of everything, especially in Nintendo consoles. Additionally, I am not a fan of Nintendo's practices of charging double the price for ports than you see on other consoles (Skyrim costs twice as much on the Switch than on the PS4/XBOX, the new Final Fantasy ports are apparently all at least 40€). [linebreak]  [linebreak] I am certainly not the only person who thinks this, because it is not the first time I see threads and comments being showered with replies that can be summed up to 'shut up and accept it' and flurries of downvotes. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Some of us do not need to relive our childhood, teenagehood or whatever with constant remakes or remasters. Some of us would like new original content or sequels. But since most people keep buying these, companies have realized they can have more profit with half the work by remaking, remastering and re-releasing these games with special edition instead of focusing on other, different projects. This is what gives us stuff like Pokémon Let's Go, which were considered very lackluster remakes with less effort put in them than the remakes that were released over ten years before and what also makes us buy games that are no more than beta versions, since DLC/complete versions come out the year later. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I am not trying to attack eventual posters that identify with this mindset I am disagreeing with. There are remakes/remasters that are really good to introduce a new generation to a certain game (Pokémon Fire Red/Leaf Green, The 3DS Zelda remasters), but there is a growing trend of remakes/remasters/complete edtions that are basically just to profit as much as they can off one game without altering it much. And that is what some of us want to voice their disapproval over, but can't because the downvote brigade rains down on dissent.

I feel like I've missed out on a lot of things I should've had experienced by now & that it's probably too late to catch up. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Every day is as boring as the previous one. If someone was looking at me all day, all they would see would be some fat guy sitting in front of a gigantic screen with a poker face. [linebreak]  [linebreak] It's sad, man. Every year I feel like it's too late to change, only to regret not having tried one year later. I wish I could go back in time and tell 17 years old me that no, it's not too late to get in shape, as you'll still wish to be ripped when you're 21. Or go back and tell 18 years old me that it is too early to give up any hopes of ever kissing a girl or having a social life. The list goes on. But sadly, I can't change my past. [linebreak]  [linebreak] What's even more depressing is that it is pretty much entirely my fault. Yes, I do have overprotective parents, but I should have done something. If only I had told them to fuck off whenever they asked where I was going, with who, and that endless amount of questions they asked (and still ask) me every time I opened the door, my life could have been a lot more different. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Nowadays, I often act against my own interests solely out of fear. For example: some weeks ago, I messaged a girl I had been texting for around a month (I don't know if I like her as a friend & it's just my mind playing tricks on me because of my inexperience or if I actually like her romantically) at around 3 am and since I didn't get an answer half an hour later I decided to pop some sleeping pills and head to bed. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Right after waking up, I saw her reply. She answered 10 minutes after I knocked myself out. Said she was at some club and told me to drop by if I wanted. A few minutes later, she mentioned that she was going to the beach later if I wanted to go. And that she was leaving the town we both were at at a certain hour. [linebreak]  [linebreak] What did I do? I saw the message an hour before she said she would leave (in the notification panel with my phone in flight mode so she wouldn't know I saw it) and answered an hour after she left with some crappy excuse as to why I couldn't answer earlier. Even though I really wanted to see her. [linebreak]  [linebreak] My lack of social skills angers me. I know I would've done the exact same thing if I hadn't gone to bed before her reply. Why? Because I fear that my awkwardness would drive her away. Especially at a nightclub (only went three times to one, none of them were 'successful' nights at all). The beach was also a terrifying idea because in addition to having zero social skills, I'm not happy with my body at all. [linebreak]  [linebreak] It's not that I'm an introvert. Socializing tends to make me happier and more energetic for the rest of the day. It kills me when I find something funny on the internet and I have no one to share it with. Or when I want to go to the movies or something and I have no one to go with. I dislike being by myself most of the time. I'd love to have a group of friends to go out and have fun with. Or even go on vacations with, like some do. But since I tend to bore people on one-on-one conversations and I usually get kind of ignored when in a group, it looks like an unattainable goal. And I'd love to go to nightclubs, but I don't have the social skills to really enjoy it. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I've recently tried to lose weight again, successfully. Lost 6% bodyfat but I 'gave up' again two weeks ago. I'm struggling once again with the false belief that it's too late to improve. That the door has already closed. The same dumb questions arise: \"Why would I want to be ripped at 22? Will I even be able to catch up with social skills? Will it even be worth it?\".

When a victim of a crime comes forward, the people that they trust should absolutely support them, and help them get help and try to make it as easy as possible to get the police involved - not necessarily influence them to go to the authorities, but that's where crimes *should* go, for a number of reasons.

[linebreak]  [linebreak] With the Jussie Smollett case, we see both of those in play.  When the police investigation unfolded, they were able to put forth compelling evidence against his claim.  The second set is more nuanced, but this is how I see it:  His claims had a major effect to divide the country.  Seeing these claims would have such an effect, it gives us good reason to scrutinize his story.  When we scrutinize the story, we find some major holes (two maga people out after 2 in intensely cold weather, in Chicago, apparently knowing where Smollett was, and being prepared for that confrontation, his refusal to hand over his phone, he walked home and waited 40 minutes or so before calling the police) and we have a good reason to step back a bit from the narrative and wait for an investigation to conclude before deciding.
