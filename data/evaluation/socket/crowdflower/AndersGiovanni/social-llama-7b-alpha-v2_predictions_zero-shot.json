I don't know much about star wars, but I know a few of the characters and their names. I also have seen a few episodes, and I know that a Jedi is a good guy, and that Darth Vader is the bad guy. So I think I know enough about star wars to have a little bit of knowledge about it, enough to be happy about it. I guess that is what I am saying here. I am not super into star wars, but I know a little bit about it, enough to be happy about it. That is what I mean by happy star wars day. I am not super into star wars, but I know a little bit about it, enough to be happy about it. That is what I mean by happy star wars day. Happy star wars day! Happy star wars day! Happy star wars day! Happy star wars day! Happy star wars day! Happy star wars day! Happy star wars day! Happy star wars day! Happy star wars day! Happy star wars day! Happy star wars day! Happy star wars day! Happy",

Otherwise, there's no charge.\n\nI've never heard of calling AAA to get them to come out and unlock a car. I know there are companies that do that, but AAA is not one of them. I don't know of any other company that would do it either. You can call AAA to ask if it's covered under your contract, but I doubt it is.\n\nComment: I dont think its covered either but i was just hoping it was. I called my moms cell phone and she was in laughlin and i had no one else to call. i tried a couple of locksmith companies and they didnt come cheap. i just happened to have aAA so i called them. i dont know why they wont send someone out unless the car is out of gas or something. oh well just a little set back. thanks for your input\n\nComment: I",

And the more I notice, the more the band changes. And the more the band changes, the more interesting it gets. And that is the beauty of research.

It's an emotional song, but not a happy one. The lyrics are ambiguous in a way, but I would say sadness and regret, mixed with a sense of relief.\n\nComment: I think that's the beauty of literature (and music) - how it can be interpreted in so many different ways. I think you've given a very good explanation of the song, and I agree with your interpretation. +1!\n\nComment: @Jenna I agree with everything you said. The song is beautiful.
