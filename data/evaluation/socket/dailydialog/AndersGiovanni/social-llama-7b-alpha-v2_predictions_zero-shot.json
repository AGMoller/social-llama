If you do not want to tell, then just say no. But if they press further, you can say, \"I cannot tell you, but I will not tell anyone else either.\"\n\nComment: +1 for not pressing further. The best way to respond is to not press further. It is a polite way out.\n\nAnswer: \"I'm sorry I cannot tell you\" is a nice way out.

I wouldn't have a problem with any of the neutral answers, but I'd prefer neutral to some other answer, just because neutral is usually best. Also, since there's no room for interpretation, I don't think it's possible to get the neutral answer wrong. If you're choosing neutral, you're right. If you pick some other answer, you're wrong. Simple as that. So no need to worry about getting it wrong. No one is going to disagree with you, because there's no room for disagreement. If you want some more flexibility, you'll have to choose something other than neutral. But if you want accuracy, go with neutral. Nothing wrong with neutral.\n\nComment: Noemotion?! Wow!

If they did not express any emotion then it is not possible to know what their emotion is or was. That is why the neutral notemotion is correct. If they did express emotion then we could infer what it was. Noemotion means there was no emotion expressed. This is not a subjective decision, it is a factual one. Noemotion means noemotion.

You don't believe in truth? :wink: Truth is not about emotion. Truth is true, not emotional. Truth cannot be emotional, but there can be emotion related to the truth. For example, some people may feel sadness or remorse when confronted with the truth. Others may feel anger or guilt. Truth, however, is not emotional in and of itself. Truth is true, no matter how we feel about it. If you are looking for an emotional response to truth, you are looking in the wrong place. Truth is cold and unemotional. It is like the sun. It simply is what it is. No emotion involved.\n\nComment: @Darren you should be aware of the difference between truth and fact. Truth is not necessarily a fact. A fact is a verifiable, objective piece of information. Truth, on the other hand, is not verifiable or objective.",

He was born in Lichfield on 18 September 1709, and died in London on 13 December 1784. Johnson was arguably the most famous English man of letters after his death, and he has sometimes been called \"the most distinguished man of his age\". He was a great scholar with a wide range of knowledge, including Latin, Greek, philosophy, science, and literature. He has been described as \"essayist\", \"biographer\", \"literary critic\", \"poet\", and \"man of letters\". He was a devout Anglican and Tory, and has been called \"one of the greatest figures of 18th century English literature\". Johnson was born into a working class family with low social status, and his father was a bookseller's apprentice. Johnson never attended university, but his reading was extensive, and he later became a poet",
