This phrase suggests a sense of hopelessness or resignation.\n2. Mention of a previous earthquake that caused significant damage: The speaker mentions an 8.8 earthquake that occurred in the same location as the latest earthquake, and notes that it triggered a tsunami and caused significant damage and loss of life. This serves as a reminder of the devastating consequences of earthquakes, which can lead to feelings of fear and anxiety.\n3. Reflection on the severity of the latest earthquake: The speaker notes that the latest earthquake had a magnitude of 6.4, which is significant but not as severe as the 8.8 earthquake. However, they acknowledge that it could have been worse if it had struck in a different location. This suggests a sense of vulnerability and concern about the potential for future earthquakes.\n4. Gratitude for a warning system: The speaker expresses gratitude for a warning system that has been put in place since the 8.8 earthquake. This suggests that they recognize the importance of being prepared for earthquakes and the potential for loss of life.\n\nOverall, while the speaker does not appear to be in distress in the immediate sense, the text suggests that they are experiencing a range of emotions related to the recurrence of earthquakes in Chile and the potential for future damage.
