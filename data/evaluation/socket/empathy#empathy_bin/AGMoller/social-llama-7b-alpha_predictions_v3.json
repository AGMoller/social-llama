I believe its because of deppression. We aren't happy and its because of money. Humans are always working they have no life. Work is not life. Some people don't get to spend time with there kids or family. They cant even have time for themselves. There worried about work, what time they have to get up, or what they will eat because they don't have time to cook. So we eat unhealthy thing that can lead to depression. Not getting enough sleep or the right nutrients lead to sicknesses. Theres people who don't have enough time to see a doctor. Our lifestyle is the reason we're not getting enough sleep. People put way to much on there plate just so they can have money. Everything is about money.\", is it expressing empathy?
