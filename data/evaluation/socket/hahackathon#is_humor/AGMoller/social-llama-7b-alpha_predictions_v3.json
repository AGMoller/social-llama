Firstly, it would be challenging to determine the scope of such a court, as it would require a clear definition of what constitutes a \"non-illegal\" issue. Secondly, it would be difficult to establish the jurisdiction of such a court, as it would likely overlap with other legal frameworks. Finally, it would be challenging to ensure the impartiality and fairness of such a court, as it would be difficult to ensure that the judges and jurors are not biased towards one party or the other.\n\nWhile I understand the humor in your suggestion, I hope you can appreciate the complexity of the issue you have raised.
