The idea that someone's ancestral trauma gives them a pass or makes them more obligated to social justice is not a humorous or acceptable notion. It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their ancestry or background, are entitled to equal rights and dignity.\n\nThe idea of \"ancestral trauma\" is a serious one that refers to the historical and ongoing experiences of oppression, violence, and discrimination that have affected marginalized communities, including the Jewish community. It is not something that should be used as a justification for ignoring or dismissing the social justice issues faced by these communities.\n\nInstead, we should strive to create a society that acknowledges and addresses the systemic inequalities and injustices that have been perpetuated against marginalized communities throughout history. This requires a commitment to understanding and respecting the experiences and perspectives of these communities, and working towards a more equitable and just society for all.",
