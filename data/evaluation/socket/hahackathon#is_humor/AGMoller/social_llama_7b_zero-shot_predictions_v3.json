The amount of rest you need will depend on a variety of factors, including your fitness level, the type of exercise you're doing, and your individual muscle recovery needs.\n\nHowever, as a general guideline, many fitness professionals recommend taking at least 60-90 seconds of rest between sets for most exercises. This allows your muscles to recover and replenish their energy stores, which can help you lift heavier weights and perform better in your workouts.\n\nOf course, it's important to listen to your body and adjust your rest time as needed.

I don't think that Twitter is a healthy or sustainable solution for curing loneliness. In fact, I believe that excessive social media use can actually exacerbate feelings of loneliness and isolation.\n\nResearch has shown that social media can lead to a decrease in face-to-face interactions and an increase in feelings of loneliness, depression, and anxiety. This is because social media often presents a curated and unrealistic version of people's lives, which can lead to unrealistic expectations and a sense of inadequacy.\n\nInstead of turning to social media as a cure for loneliness, I would recommend engaging in activities that promote meaningful social connections and self-care. This could include volunteering, joining a club or organization, or simply spending time with loved ones. These types of activities can help to build social connections and improve mental health in a more sustainable and healthy way.\n\nIn conclusion, while I understand the temptation to turn to social media as a quick fix for loneliness, I strongly advise against it. Instead, focus on building meaningful connections and practicing self-care in a way that promotes overall well-being.",

This can involve educating ourselves and others about mental health, reducing stigmatizing language and behaviors, and advocating for policies and practices that promote mental health and well-being.\n\nIn short, while I understand the sentiment behind the sentence, I do not believe it is the most effective or respectful way to address the issue of mental health stigma.
