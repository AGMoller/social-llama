The advice that \"you should always know who you're going in for\" and \"if not just forget about relationships\" seems a bit harsh. Some people need time to find out who they want to be in a relationship with, and not all relationships work out. The advice to always be decisive in who you're with may not be the best advice, and it might make people more wary of commitment. It could also be seen as a bit self-critical, implying that the speaker is not sure about their own ability to choose the right partner. The advice to just \"forget about relationships\" is also a bit extreme, and it may not be realistic for everyone. Some people value relationships and may not be willing to give up on finding the right person. The speaker's experience with relationships may not be representative of everyone's experience, and it's important to be mindful of that when offering advice. Overall, this quote is honest",

However, it's not a guaranteed death sentence. And even if it does weaken the immune system, there are many other factors that affect immunity, including genetics and other lifestyle choices. It's important to remember that stress can be a challenge, but it's not always the root cause of every medical condition.\n\nComment: Agree with your comment about not being the root cause of every medical condition. Stress is definitely not the root cause of every medical condition, but it can exacerbate existing medical conditions.
