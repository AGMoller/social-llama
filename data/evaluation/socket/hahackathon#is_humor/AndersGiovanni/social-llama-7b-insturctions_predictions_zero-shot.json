The joke is offensive because it perpetuates stereotypes about rural people and their living situations, implying that they are poor and live in substandard housing.

Many people experience a decrease in appetite as they age, and it can be challenging to eat more than once a day, especially if your digestive system is sensitive. It's understandable that you may find it easier to control your weight when eating less frequently. However, it's important to listen to your body and adjust your eating habits accordingly. It's also worth noting that eating too little can lead to nutrient deficiencies and other health issues. It's important to consult with a healthcare professional to determine the best eating plan for your individual needs.",
