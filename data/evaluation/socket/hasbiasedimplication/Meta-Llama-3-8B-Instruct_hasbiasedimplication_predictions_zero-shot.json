The tone is quite aggressive and condescending, and the use of \"get ova it\" and \"leave @dan_edgar1 alone\" suggests that the person is upset and feels strongly about the situation. Additionally, the mention of \"Ur ex bird cheated\" implies a personal vendetta against Dan Edgar and his current partner, Jamie.\n\nThe bias is likely against Dan Edgar and his partner, as the person is dismissing the relationship and implying that Dan is somehow at fault for his partner's past infidelity. The tone is not respectful or constructive, which further supports the conclusion that the sentence implies a bias.",
