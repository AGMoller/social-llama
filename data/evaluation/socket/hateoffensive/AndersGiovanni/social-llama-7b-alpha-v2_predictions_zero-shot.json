I'm not sure if it's trending or not though, I don't have any way of knowing since I'm not on twitter and don't have any friends on facebook who are friends with the people who posted it.

You have to be not racist. And that's the point where most people stop.\"\nI'm not saying everyone needs to agree with Zappa. I'm just sayin' that I think he was on to something.\nI would add that I also agree with Voltaire, who said \"I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.\"\nI'm not sure I would defend anyone's right to use the word \"nigger,\" but I am willing to defend to the death their right to use it. (not really)\n\nComment: I would say, though, that the implication is that some people are not \"willing to defend to the death\" the right of others to use the word. I think that is fair. And there is a distinction between a right and a responsibility. Just because you have a right doesn't",
