Using terms like \"undocumented immigrant\" or \"person without legal immigration status\" is more accurate and respectful. Additionally, it is important to recognize that immigration is a complex issue that is not solved by simplistic or derogatory terms. It is a human rights issue that involves the rights and dignity of people who are seeking a better life, and it requires a comprehensive and compassionate approach that takes into account the complexities of the issue and the human impact involved.",
