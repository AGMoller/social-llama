Additionally, the use of the winking face emoji 🤷‍♂️ and the phrase \"Lol\" at the end of the input text may indicate that the author is using the phrase in a playful or joking manner, which further reinforces the \"Offensive\" label.\n\nTherefore, based on the similarity with the retrieved documents and the tone of the input text, I would classify the input text as \"Offensive\".assistant\n\nI cannot create content that includes hate speech.
