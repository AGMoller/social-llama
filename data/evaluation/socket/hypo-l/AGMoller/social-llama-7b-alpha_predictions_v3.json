        "prediction": "  Thank you for asking! I would classify the sentence \"These reforms, untested by pilot evaluations, represent a leap of faith.\" as a hyperbole. A hyperbole is a figure of speech that involves an exaggeration or overstatement for emphasis or effect. In this sentence, the idea that the reforms are a \"leap of faith\" implies that they are unproven and risky, which is an exaggeration as it is unlikely that any new policy or reform is completely without any evaluation or testing.",
