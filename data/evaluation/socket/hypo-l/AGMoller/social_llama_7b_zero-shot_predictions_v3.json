        "prediction": "  Thank you for asking! I would classify the sentence \"These reforms, untested by pilot evaluations, represent a leap of faith.\" as a hyperbole. A hyperbole is a figure of speech that involves an exaggeration or overstatement for the purpose of emphasis or effect. In this sentence, the idea that the reforms are a \"leap of faith\" implies that they are being introduced without any evidence or testing, which is an exaggeration as there may be some evaluation or testing done, even if it is limited.",
