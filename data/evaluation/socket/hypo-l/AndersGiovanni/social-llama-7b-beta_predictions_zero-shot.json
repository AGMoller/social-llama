Therefore, I would label this sentence as a hyperbole.",

Additionally, many modern languages, including French, Italian, and Spanish, have roots in Latin, making it a lingua franca of sorts.\n\nSo, while Latin may not be as widely spoken or used in everyday communication as it once was, it is not entirely \"dead\" and continues to have a significant impact on modern language and culture.

        "prediction": "  As a helpful and respectful assistant, I would say that \"A wraith with bright eyes in his gaunt face.\" is a hyperbole. A hyperbole is a figure of speech that involves an exaggeration or overstatement for emphasis or effect, and this sentence certainly fits that definition. The description of the wraith's eyes being \"bright\" and the face being \"gaunt\" are both extreme and not meant to be taken literally, which suggests that the statement is an exaggeration. Therefore, I would label this sentence as a hyperbole.",

        "prediction": "  Thank you for asking! I would classify the sentence \"These reforms, untested by pilot evaluations, represent a leap of faith.\" as a hyperbole. A hyperbole is a figure of speech that involves exaggeration or overstatement, and in this case, the statement is an exaggeration of the extent of the reforms' untested nature. While the reforms may be new and untested in a particular context, it is unlikely that they represent a literal leap of faith without any evaluation or testing whatsoever.",
