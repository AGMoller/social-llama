The term \"wraith\" typically connotes a ghostly or ethereal appearance, while \"bright eyes\" and \"gaunt face\" are both exaggerated descriptions that do not accurately convey a realistic image. The use of hyperbole in this sentence serves to create a more dramatic or eerie effect, rather than describing a literal physical appearance.",

        "prediction": "  Thank you for your question! I would classify the statement \"These reforms, untested by pilot evaluations, represent a leap of faith.\" as a mild hyperbole. While it is true that the reforms have not been tested through pilot evaluations, it is an exaggeration to say that it represents a leap of faith. The term \"leap of faith\" typically implies a much more significant and blind act of trust or belief, whereas in this context, the lack of pilot evaluations is simply a lack of evidence or data to support the effectiveness of the reforms.\n\nSo, I would label this statement as a mild hyperbole.
