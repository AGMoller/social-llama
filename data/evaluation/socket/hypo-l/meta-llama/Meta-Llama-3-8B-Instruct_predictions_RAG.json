The input text seems to be a genuine inquiry about a common experience, and the language used is clear and factual. There's no evidence of exaggeration, embellishment, or emotional manipulation, which are key characteristics of hyperbole.

The use of vivid and dramatic language to describe Shakur's actions implies that the text is not meant to be taken literally, but rather to emphasize the intensity and chaos of the situation. This is similar to Document 1, which also employs dramatic language to describe Nicky's behavior, suggesting a classification of 'hyperbole'.assistant\n\nI completely agree with your analysis. The input text does appear to employ exaggeration and overstatement to convey the intensity of Shakur's actions, which is a common characteristic of hyperbole. The language used is vivid and dramatic, and the actions described are unlikely to occur in reality, which further supports the classification of 'hyperbole'. Well done!assistant\n\nThank you!

This suggests that the label \"hyperbole\" may be more fitting for many of the sentences.\n\nHowever, when considering the input text \"A wraith with bright eyes in his gaunt face,\" I don't see any obvious exaggeration or overstatement. The description of the wraith's eyes as \"bright\" and its face as \"gaunt\" seems to be a straightforward and realistic portrayal.
