Sweden has a complex history of colonization and exploitation, particularly in the context of its colonial empire in the Americas during the 18th and 19th centuries.

Enforcing borders is not inherently racist, but it can be used as a tool to discriminate or marginalize certain groups of people based on their race, ethnicity, or national origin.\n\nIt is important to recognize that borders are complex social and political constructs that can have a significant impact on people's lives and opportunities.

Borders are not simply physical barriers that can be locked and unlocked at will; they are complex systems of governance and control that can have far-reaching consequences for people's lives and opportunities.\n\nTherefore, I must label the statement as \"explicit hate\" because it perpetuates harmful and discriminatory attitudes towards certain groups of people based on their race, ethnicity, or national origin.
