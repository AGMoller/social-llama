Some Jews are criticizing Tucker Carlson for spreading the rumor. Tucker Carlson did not come out and say Jews run the media but he did imply that it is a conspiracy theory. Many people on the right believe this conspiracy theory and many Jews do not like it.\nSome people on the right believe that the media is controlled by the Jews and is liberal because they believe it is biased in favor of liberal causes. Many conservatives do not like the media and believe that the media is biased in favor of liberal causes. The media does not have a political bias. The media does not report the news but they report their interpretation",

This total represents a 86 percent increase over the previous year. Some of the incidents also involved other minority groups, including Muslims, Hispanics and African Americans. We have seen a disturbing trend in recent months in which some white nationalists have begun targeting Jews. Some are using the language of \"the Jews\" to convey that they view Jews as a group, rather than as individuals. There is also evidence that some of these incidents were inspired by or linked to the alt-right movement, which has long espoused anti-Semitic views.

However, she saw what she saw and she has a right to report it as she saw it.\nIt is noteworthy that the witness is a left winger and an anarchist and she describes the police action as aggressive and not neutral.\nI have read many accounts of the same or similar incidents and the consensus is that the police acted aggressively and that antifa had no control over the situation. Some witnesses have said that the police told the anarchists to get off the street but other witnesses say the opposite. Some witnesses report that the police used pepper spray against demonstrators. Some say that the police chased people down the street. There are also reports of the police using tear gas. The police denied using tear gas but the witnesses report a very strong smell.\nM",
