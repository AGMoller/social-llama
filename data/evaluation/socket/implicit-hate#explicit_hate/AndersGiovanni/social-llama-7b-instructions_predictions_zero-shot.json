It is not racist to enforce borders, as they are put in place to protect a country's security and sovereignty. However, the manner in which borders are enforced can be seen as discriminatory or xenophobic, particularly if it involves treating people of certain races or nationalities differently. The comparison to locking the doors to one's home is not a good analogy, as it oversimplifies the complex issue of immigration and national security. A more accurate comparison might be to a neighborhood with strict security measures to protect its residents from harm, rather than a fortress wall",
