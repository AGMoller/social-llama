The term white male was used by black people to express resentment about the racial bias in the hiring practices of railroad companies. Many African Americans, including W. E. B. DU Bois, believed that white men were prejudiced against black men in order to maintain the economic and social superiority of white Americans. They argued that this economic and social advantage was made possible by the social and legal status of white men, which was founded upon racial oppression of black men in the United States. During the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, black men were denied access to employment in most industries and professional fields. The denial of access to employment was justified by various theories which emphasized the societal inferiority of black people.\n I think it is implicit racist.",

In either case, some people will see it as a bad thing, while others will see it as a positive thing. For example, people in the BNP and other parties like it, and people in Stormfront and other neo-Nazi groups see it as a bad thing.
