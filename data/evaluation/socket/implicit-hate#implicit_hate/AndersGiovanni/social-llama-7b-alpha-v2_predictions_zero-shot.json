Proceed with caution.\nImmediately following the Civil War, many white Americans believed that black people were not equal to white people and could not be educated or vote as equals. Between 1877 and 1965, Jim Crow laws enacted in most Southern states required racial segregation in public facilities and schools, directed racial inequality in jobs, housing and transportation, and sometimes denied black people the right to vote. Jim Crow laws were overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark 1954 ruling in Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas. However, it took the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to end legal segregation and discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex or national origin.\n\n### Reference: https://www.history.com/topics/black-history",
