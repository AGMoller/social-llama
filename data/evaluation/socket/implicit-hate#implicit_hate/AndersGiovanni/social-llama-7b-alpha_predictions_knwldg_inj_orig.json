Implicit hate can be just as harmful as explicit hate, as it can perpetuate negative stereotypes and contribute to a toxic and discriminatory environment.\n\nIn conclusion, the sentence \"for those us us who were there  we are 100 % sure that the police action was planned and intentional. watch my charlottesville 2.0 video for more detail and context  fam.\" can be labeled as \"implicit hate\".
