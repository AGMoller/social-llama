The use of racial or ethnic stereotypes to make generalizations about criminality is not only offensive, but also lacks context and ignores the complex factors that contribute to criminal behavior.\n\nIt is important to recognize that crime is a multifaceted issue that involves a variety of factors, including socio-economic conditions, education, family structure, and mental health. It is not accurate or fair to attribute criminal behavior to any one group or demographic, and it is important to avoid perpetuating harmful stereotypes or stigmatizing entire communities.\n\nInstead of relying on racial or ethnic stereotypes, it is important to address the root causes of crime and work towards creating a fair and just society for all. This can involve addressing issues such as poverty, inequality, and discrimination, as well as providing access to education, job training, and mental health resources.\n\nIn conclusion, the sentence \"84 % of all wanted criminals in copen",
