The Holocaust was a tragic event in human history that resulted in the murder of six million Jews and millions of others deemed undesirable by the Nazi regime. It is important to approach discussions of the Holocaust with respect, sensitivity, and a commitment to understanding and learning.\n\nUsing the term \"holocaust\" in a debate or to make light of it can be hurtful and offensive to those who were affected by the event, as well as to their descendants and the broader community. It is important to be mindful of the language we use and the impact it can have on others.\n\nIn general, it is important to approach discussions of sensitive topics with respect, empathy, and an open mind.
