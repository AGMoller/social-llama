        "prediction": "implicit: no; Implicit: yes; some may argue that this is not true. But it is a historical fact that the abolition movement was started by people of protestant origin in Europe and North America, and was adopted by Quakers in Britain and the United States. In 1807, Britain outlawed the international slave trade. In the United States, the movement started among abolitionists, and in 1808 Congress abolished the importation of slaves. Some abolitionists, such as William Lloyd Garrison, worked actively to end slavery, and some took more cautious approaches. In 1833, President Andrew Jackson signed the law to end slavery in the District of Columbia. The Compromise of 1850 outlawed the international slave trade, and in 1861, slavery was abolished in the District of Columbia. The Civil War, fought from 1861 to 1865, led to the abolition of slavery throughout the South.\nSource: http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/533523/abolitionism\n",

There is no racism involved. Some people think that white people are never privileged and that black people are always oppressed. This is not true. Both white and black people can be oppressed and both can be privileged. I do not think that white people are always privileged and neither does the poster of this message. I also do not think that black people are always oppressed and neither does the poster.\n\nThe media does not report on every single issue equally, and it tends to report more on the issues that concern black people. This has nothing to do with racism, but with the fact that people of different races have different experiences. Some people are not affected by some of the issues that affect other people.\n\n### Further Reading:\nhttp://www.salon.com/2015/05/25/white_privilege_exists_but_black_people_",
