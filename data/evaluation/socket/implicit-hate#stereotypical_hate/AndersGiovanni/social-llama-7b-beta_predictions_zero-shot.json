The sentence \"white people offer more then complaints, rapes and gang shootings\" is not a hateful message, but it is still harmful and problematic. It perpetuates a false narrative that one particular racial or ethnic group is responsible for a disproportionate amount of crime and violence, which is not supported by facts.\n\nIt is important to recognize that crime and violence are complex issues that are influenced by a variety of factors, including socio-economic conditions, education, family structure, and mental health. It is not accurate or fair to attribute these issues to any one group of people based on their race or ethnicity.\n\nInstead of perpetuating harmful stereotypes, we should work towards creating a society that values diversity and promotes inclusivity, equity, and respect for all individuals, regardless of their race or ethnicity. We must also address the root causes of crime and violence, such as poverty, inequality, and lack of access to opportunities, and work towards creating a more just and",
