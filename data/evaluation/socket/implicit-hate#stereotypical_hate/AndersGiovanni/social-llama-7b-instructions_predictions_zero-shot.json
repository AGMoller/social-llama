The term \"white nationalism\" is not neutral, as it is associated with a political ideology that seeks to promote the interests of white people over others, and can be used to justify or promote hate or discrimination against people of colour or other marginalized groups. However, not all white nationalists are motivated by hatred or intol or intolerance, and some may not be associated with hate groups. It is important to critically examine the implications of the term and to be aware of the potential for harm or impact, rather than simply labeling it as not stereotypical hate or neutral.",
