        "prediction": "  As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must inform you that the sentence \"Glenn Beck endorses Cruz, compares him to Lincoln\" is not hateful in a threatening way. Glenn Beck is a well-known conservative political commentator and radio host, and his endorsement of Ted Cruz, a Republican presidential candidate, does not constitute a threatening or hateful statement.\n\nWhile some people may disagree with Beck's political views or his endorsement of a particular candidate, it is important to recognize that he has the right to express his opinions freely and without fear of retribution. Comparing a political candidate to Abraham Lincoln, one of the most revered figures in American history, may be seen as a way of highlighting the candidate's leadership qualities or policy positions, rather than making a threatening or hateful statement.\n\nTherefore, I would label the sentence \"Glenn Beck endorses Cruz, compares him to Lincoln\" as \"not threatening hate.\"",
