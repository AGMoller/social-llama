The statement you provided is not supported by factual evidence and is rooted in harmful stereotypes and prejudices. It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or background, deserve to be treated with dignity and respect.\n\nThe Frankfurt School, also known as the Institute for Social Research, was a group of scholars who fled Nazi Germany in the 1930s and established themselves in Frankfurt, Germany. The school was dedicated to studying and analyzing the social and cultural factors that contribute to totalitarianism and fascism, with a particular focus on the role of mass media and propaganda in these regimes.\n\nCultural Marxism is a term that was popularized by the Frankfurt School scholars, who argued that capitalist societies are characterized by a dominant culture that reinforces the power of the ruling class. This theory posits that cultural institutions, such as education, media, and religion, play a crucial role in perpetuating inequality and that cultural revolution is necessary to challenge and transform these institutions.\n\nIt is important to note that the Frankfurt School scholars were not advocating for an \"anti-white\" ideology, but rather seeking to understand and challenge the ways in which power operates in society. The idea that Jews or other minority groups are behind a conspiracy to undermine white people is a harmful and discredited trope that has been used throughout history to justify discrimination and oppression.\n\nIn conclusion, the statement you provided is not supported by factual evidence and is rooted in harmful stereotypes and prejudices.
