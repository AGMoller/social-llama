The term \"cuck\" is a derogatory slur that is often used to demean and belittle individuals, particularly in the context of online communities. The use of this term in the sentence suggests that the speaker may be unaware of its offensive connotations or may be using it in a non-pejorative manner.\n\nThe statement \"Ive been a cuck my whole life\" could be interpreted as a reflection of the speaker's sense of self-deprecation or self-doubt, rather than a deliberate attempt to use the term in a derogatory manner. Additionally, the mention of the speaker's father holding them with a disgusted look on his face and the speaker's belief that they will never have a chance with women due to their appearance suggests that the speaker may be struggling with feelings of inadequacy or low self-esteem.\n\nOverall, based on the language and tone used in the sentence, it is more likely that the use of the term \"cuck\" is not intentional",
