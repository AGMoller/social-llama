Also, just because a word has a historical meaning doesn't mean that it can't ever mean anything else as culture develops. The word rap meant \"\"to knock, as on a door\"\" up until the late 70s for example. Would you deny the more modern use of the term? The English language has no board to regulate it, as French does with the L'Académie française, so you have no basis for defining what the word means. We have groups and documents that define the proper use of words like \"\"you're\"\" and \"\"your\"\", for example, but none such for words like bukkake. If it can be shown that it is used in a particular way, that is valid. My personal belief is that there is no need for the qualifier \"\"gay\"\", just as there is no need to call men having anal sex \"\"gay anal sex\"\", but that's really irrelevent.   I think it is important to make clear the historical implications, but not to deny that we are currently creating and modifying language. Even the fact that we have taken the word bukkake, \"\"splash\"\", from Japan and created this very specific connotation of splashing not just anything, but specifically semen and specifically onto a person's face shows that this term is elastic and subject not to rules that we impose on it, but by the meaning that it has to the people who use it.     \"\", is it a threat?

I know you say there are serious demands, i oppose it and call them original research and neutral point of view. \"\"rejecting contributions from new editors \"\", \"\"patronising new editors\"\", \"\"and intense personal hostility towards new editors\"\" this is absolut out of the context. First, you made major changes without writting them down on the talk page. Second, after your edits have been reverted you placed a copyright template. At last, i was not the one who started to be offensive! On the contrary, when you or henriettapussycat wanted to leave i asked to continue your work! The answer was, because i did not agree with the claim of a copyright violation, i was called stupid, and that i dont understand copyright violations. After this i got offensive, not before!

Do you really think their work is based on persons with lesser qualifications, knowledge and experience?  It seems to me that you and Henriettapussycat project your false and unlogic conclusions on others, add some logical definitions out of the context to act a logical conclusion related to the original issue.

For all your \"\"expertise\"\" the whole lot of your gang still cannot write something reliable when it comes to the numbers of linguistic groups in Greece. I drop the hint about the V-PRC survey and your sorry lot still go on about Kiesling's State Department estimate.   Even after citing the Eurominority reports (while making sure the Arvanitika in Epirus are shown as Albanian) you still have not updated your map of linguistic minorities in Greece to show the Arvanites in Thrace. I mean you fools show half of my island as Arvanite speaking when the language is unfortunately almost entirely lost and despite there being more active speakers in Thrace you don't even show them. So much for \"\"expertise\"\" and respect for the sources.  You complain that you are misunderstood with respect to your broad use of the color brush in the map of Macedonian Slavic dialects in Greece even when it is pointed out to you that your color maps include areas where there were never any settlements of Slavic speaking villages at all. Then you trivialize objections (\"\"a few kilometers\"\" etc.) and suggest that what you do is perfectly kosher. But when you prepare a similar map of Greek dialects http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Modern_Greek_dialects_en.svg instead of following the same rationale and including areas of minimal use of the Greek language (even if it was in the past and no more - just as you argue for your Macedonian map) you stop at the borders of Greece. Obviously the Greeks in Albania and Bulgaria (I won't bother with the Greek linguistic presence - especially in the past - in the Bitola, Gevgelija and Strumica region as I expect them to be invisible to you) are not worth recording (or maybe they are mute in your pretty little world). What about the Greek speaking Turks still left in Turkey (mainly from Crete and Macedonia as well as the Pontus)? I mean OK, screw the linguistic presence in Turkey before 1922 - you obviously have perverse ideas of what time boundaries to use - but at least respect today's reality. If my grandfather's bilingual generation of Arvanite speakers make half the island of Andros Arvanite should you not indicate the presence of the Greek speaking old-people in Turkey? Your double standards are so blatantly obvious it is not even funny that a person such as you wields so much power in WP.

My opinion is as follows. I think the link at the end of the \"\"Primal Therapy\"\" section should lead to the \"\"Primal Therapy\"\" article, not to the criticism section specifically. I feel that way because the section in the page entitled \"\"Primal Therapy\"\" is relevant to the entire primal therapy article (including the criticisms) and not to the criticisms alone.  It would be quite possible to have both links at the bottom of the paragraph (\"\"see Primal Therapy, including the criticism section...\"\"). I wouldn't be opposed to that.   Personally I don't believe that the section \"\"Primal Therapy\"\" should be on the biography page at all; we should have a link only: \"\"Arthur Janov is the creator of (linked) Primal Therapy, and author of many books on that subject\"\". IMO there is no need to discuss primal therapy (or its criticisms) in any detail on a biography page, because those things are not biographical details. They are not relevant here. They belong in the Primal Therapy article, and there is no need to repeat that article here.  With regard to the DBT.com link. I don't believe this page is an appropriate place for any kind of dispute about Primal Therapy, one way or the other, since this article is not about Primal Therapy. I don't believe that we should include here links to any sites unless they are specifically relevant to the biography of Arthur Janov. If we do have any such links  (like the DBT.com link) then we must revisit the whole debate here, and we must include other links, otherwise we violate NPOV by representing only one side. It would be better just not to have such links.  Bear in mind that Art Janov is an exceedingly minor historical figure. His biography should be only a few paragraphs. It's not really the best place for an extensive argument.  I realize you guys are concerned about people being led astray by reading the wiki, but I really don't think that's a major concern. Anyone who follows a \"\"Primal Therapy\"\" link and reads the article will realize that Primal Therapy has been criticized. The readers aren't dense and don't need things repeated. In other words, I don't think anyone could be misled or led astray by a simple link (and nothing more) on the biography page.  We should achieve some kind of consensus before editing the article. If we can't achieve consensus then we should solicit outside opinion.    \"\", is it a threat? You can choose from the following labels: \"not threat\", \"threat\"\nAnswer: [/INST]",

As I understand it, Phil her manager in the UK *is* still blocked, save from editing his own talkpage to discuss unblocking procedures.   Due to tech-related difficulties with inability to type colons (perhaps he edits from a tablet with no physical keyboard?), and because he did some impersonation of Sophia and some creation of new usernames for evasion-and-or-socking, Phil may need to wait for the Usual Six Months prior to requesting an unblock of his User:Welshmusiclover account, should he wish to return to wikipedia and get himself back into wikipedian-in-good-standing status.    I believe that Sophia can, if she so wishes, give Phil some pointers on the wiki-rules, and on the use of talkpages, and other such topics, which will immensely improve Phil's chances of getting his own username unblocked.    But they should both read WP:MEATPUPPET very carefully, so that they don't cross the wiki-rules against socking and puppetry and making edits on behalf of other people.

[Aftermath note 1]: I created this topic when I was concerned there might be an serious (emergency) situation, but did not have sufficient knowledge of the editor's history (especially recent onwiki conversations) to judge how serious the matter was — but I had just observed behavior which was sufficiently out of the norm to not simply dismiss the replacement/message on their user page.  (interact)     [Aftermath note 2.a]: I  may be incorrect, but I do not believe Equazcion had sufficient knowledge of the history of the administrator to simply dismiss the matter. Unfortunately, there may be more to discuss about the interaction above, but let us first clarify if I am correct or incorrect with regard to Equazcion's knowledge of the administrator history (especially recent communications/interactions).  (interact)    [Aftermath note 2.b]: In the interaction above Equazcion has characterized my interaction with the administrator (on User talk: Jimbo Wales) prior to the administrator's user page replacement message. Before we discuss this further, perhaps Equazcion may wish to reconsider the characterizations.  (interact)    (I will immediately notify Equazcion of the notes 2.a and 2.b above so they may comment.  (interact)  )  ===Question(s) for administrators regarding the user talk message=== The big question, of course, do we need to follow up regarding this?  Clearly an administrator replacing their user page (and especially leaving it that way for 12 hours) with that is an inappropriate reaction to any situation.  Note that the administrator's edits just prior to their user page replacement were:  User talk: Jimbo Wales Revision as of 02:27, 14 February 2010 Rodhullandemu (→Bloqued WHY?: reply, and fuck you.)

I should pay more attention to ads, I guess.  Anyway, it quickly settled back to more normal terminology, like \"\"epitaxial wafer\"\", looks like.  I guess another move is in order.      Hi , I think it best to look at all those Google searches on the Talk page, and see which spelling/nomenclature  adding the web + book, singular + plural spellings (that's four searches for each spelling)  has the most hits, for the title of the article. If you want, I can do that and add them up. Of course, the company name will skew \"\"epiwafer\"\" so we can exclude that if you like.    We don't use plurals, and book searches are generally more authoritative than web searches, but feel free to provide more data.     Plurals are for the Google searches, because obviously many of the mentions (even in books) are only in plural, not singular, so an exact-phrase Google search (i.e., in quotation marks) will omit those mentions unless a plural form is searched. I'm fine with the fully spelled-out version as long as all of the other spellings redirect to it; therefore should probably also create a redirect for Epi-wafer, since that hyphenated form is sometimes used as well.

The Genseiryū Karate-do International Federation article is clearly being vandalized by Mario Roering as he removes links and references from the article with false reasoning. Example here []. The link clearly shows, that the book exist, and who the author is. Here Mario Roering removes yet another reference, even though the reference clearly states, that this is the first book ever []. Here Mario Roering ads a link to a Taido site, with an essay on the history of TAIDO, not Genseiryu [], thus irrelevant on the issue of Genseiryu. This reference has some correct dates, some correct information, but is at best only a collection of information found on the Internet from various other sources and is as well full of equally incorrect information. Mario Roering does not cite any phrase of the essay, and he does not provide any reasons for why this reference should be better than the one already included. Thus this is not a researched essay or document. Also Taido is siding with the WGKF and supporting them as can be seen on many pictures, and even the agreement of the establishment of the WGKF. At best, this reference is a none supported, none factual and partial essay. And like it says, it is an essay on Taido, not Genseiryu. As a third party reference this is not valid. Many of the things Mario Roering has disputed in the great many earlier edits, is among others, that Kunihiko Tosa (president of the GKIF) was not the first student of the founder Seiken Shukumine, but in this essay it says that he started taking lessons from the founder in 1952, one year prior to the establishment of Genseiryu in 1953. The essays mentions that Kunihiko Tosa published A (some) book on Genseiryu, which is I guess the reason for Mario Roering to include this \"\"source\"\". Using this argument as a counterargument to my source and claim, is the same as leaving it up to me to proof a negative. That Kunihiko Tosa wrote and published a book on Genseiryu in 1984 is confirmed in the essay as well as other sources included by me, but it does not say that the book is the first ever on Genseiryu. As I mentioned above, this is like saying that when something is not mentioned, it is not so, which of course cannot be laid down as fact or support for removing my claim as this book being the first ever on Genseiryu. Another point is, that if Mario Roering wants to include this essay as a valid reference, he must accept all the postulates in the essay, also the ones that he has disputed many times before. But, well, I guess that will not happen. Thus this reference should be discarded, as it is not trustworthy as a reference, but merely a collection of information found on the Internet. The author is not named (could not find it anyway) and the sources used in this essay are not listed. Here [] Mario Roering deletes a valuable link to a reference part of Kunihiko Tosa's book written in 1984. In this book, the founder of Genseiryu, Seiken Shukumine, wrote a preface and he co-authored the book as a technical advisor, as well as he himself recognized this book as being Genseiryu. The reference is thus a valid one, but it is my opinion, that Mario Roering wants this left out, simply because this contradicts his own views and his perception of what is the true Genseiryu. In Mario Roering's world, he would feel a lot better, if this book and the preface by the founder would simply go away, like go back in a time machine and make sure it was never published. Mario Roering has claimed on more than one occasion, that we (the GKIF) are not doing Genseiryu, but only that the WGKF is. This book clearly shows, that the founder approved and supported Kunihiko Tosa as Genseiryu. Thus the contradictions clearly stands out. It is obvious, that Mario Roering wants it left out, simply because it shows that his claims are untrue and impossible to proof, and that it is thus easier to simply get this claim removed. Here [] Mario Roering wants to provoke me by asking for citation. It is obvious, that this information originates from an interview I had with the author Kunihiko Tosa.

What I am asking is that you make your point concisely, neutrally, (i.e. provide the point of view in a neutral way, if that makes sense), and in an encyclopedic manner.

But if you want to know what the fuss was about, it started right here: Pama–Nyungan languages. He seems to be reverter-in-charge of that page. By his own admission he knows nothing about the subject. Neither do I, as a matter of fact, but there are a couple of things that I am aware of in this field, and one of them is that the current orthodoxy is still in its hypothesis stage.

So what you are telling is not true. Sensei Shukumine never had any contact with Tosa after Tosa turned his back on him and started his own commercial Karate organization. Please see also Sensei Shukumine's personal message at a training seminar in The Netherlands with Sensei Kanai and Sensei Konno. Please see the pictures on the Genseiryu website: Taido and Genseiryu people united to celebrate 55 years Genseiryu - 40 years Taido and to commemorate Sensei Shukumine. Besides that there are pictures of Sensei Shukumine teaching several Genseiryu Teachers like Genseiryu Head Instructor Sensei Kanai in Genseiryu Head dojo situated in Ito Japan in 1996. 212.127.137.2 19:37, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)  Were you at the championship or something?  So, if Mr. Tosa never had any contact with Mr. Shukumine after 1962, then please explain these picturse of Mr. Tosa and Mr. Shukumine together on the Brazilian Genseiryu website .  Zzaroc 22:01, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)  I am sorry I didn't say Sensei Shukumine had any contact after 1962. I said he didn't had any contact after Sensei Tosa turned his back to Sensei Shukumine. This was after Sensei Shukumine wrote the preface for sensei Tosa's book about Genseiryu Butokukai. And yes I was present at the championship in Okinawa amongst other Genseiryu practitioners from Spain, Denmark, Holland, and Japan. I will try to give also a link with pictures of that event. I need a little time for that I am not an Internet black belt sorry for that. 212.127.137.2 22:53, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)  You don't have to be a black belt, when your good, by the way. But take your time, I am patient. But I was wondering. Mr. Tosa published his book in 1984, but there still a picture of him together with Mr. Shukumine in 1985 (I mean those pictures on the Brazilian site). Then there are still a few questionmarks. But by the way, did you know that Mr. Tosa received several letters all over the world, just after Mr. Shukumine died? Those letters were asked for permission if some dojo's could join the organization of Mr. Tosa. Mr. Tosa denied these people to join his organization. There was one person who send such a letter to Mr. Tosa from Holland, and you may guess who. And I have got also another question. Mr. Seiken Shukumine past away to an hart attack. But when did he started to get ill?  Zzaroc 23:59, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)  No a black belt is not needed to have a certain skill. But in most occasion it shows an amount of training effort,time. And as you probably know training effort makes you become more skillfull.  I don't know when Mr. Tosa turned his back to sensei Shukumine so maybe my remark that they didn't had any contact shouldn't be done by me because I am not aware of that specific date. So I apologize for that. But I heard this occured in the mid till end '80s.  No, I didn't know that Mr. Tosa received several letters from all over the world. I know he claimed to get a letter from Holland. I know he received one which was delivered by someone from Denmark. But I know that the letter was completely different from what is claimed by Mr. Tosa. That is also easy to believe if you are member of a Genseiryu organization in Ito which was directly connected to sensei Shukumine where Sensei Shukumine still gave, in very few occasions, lectures about Genseiryu (pictures are on the way (few days necessary)). So you can imagine you don't beg for acknowledgement by Mr. Tosa who only wants you to train his way, which is very near to Shotokan with the basic kata of Shotokan. This dojo in Holland is not interested in any connection with Mr. Tosa. For what reason, if you want to train Genseiryu the same way as sensei Shukumine taught his students? The Head Instructor of this organization is now Sensei Kanai one of the first students of Sensei Shukumine. In Sensei Shukumine's book \"\"Shin Karatedo Kyohan\"\" there are several pictures of teachers who are still in this group. I met them during the celebrating anniversary of Taido and Genseiryu beginning of this year (Jan. 2005). Many nice teachers who still respect Sensei Shukumine, as should be in the relationship with teacher and student.  I was never involved with the sickness of Sensei Shukumine and I don't like to talk about his sickness. I met Mr. Shukumine one time and talked a little bit with him. In Okinawa I only met him from a distance. So I am sorry I can't anwer this question for I didn't have such a close relationship with Sensei Shukumine.  212.127.137.2 06:48, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)  I'm not in\", is it a threat?

Yamhill is the code name of a project for ever Intel's own 64bit x86 processor, EM64T is a technology to extract the most potential capability of IA-32, making it to address up to 64TiB physical address. IA32e is not a mode of Yamhill processor, but the superset or extension of IA-32e, in other words, when ia32e enabled 32bits and 64bits codes could work seamlessly, because ia32e scale up the original IA-32 by extending the width of registers and execution units, extended segment descriptors and paging mechanism would also introduced with it. IA32e does not make a processor turn into a real 64 bit processor, but just make a 32 bit processor has the capability to do the 64 bit computing from the ground. The benefits of this is that we don't have a second 64bit-lised IA-32, what we need is an architecture completely designed for 64 bit computing from scratch, for example Itanium or something else. Janagewen on travel  — Preceding unsigned comment added by 42.2.159.106      Segmentation or Paging is the Essential Way for Physical Addressing   Intel 8086 is the very first processor in the x86 series, it has only one mode, real mode. And this name was later found in 80286. So segmentation had been accompanied with x86 processor since its beginning. Without protection mechanism introduced, segmenataion is the only way to address all possible and potential physical space. Because Segmentation is found in the real mode, so addresses in Segmentation tends to be real, with solid link the physcial address rather than virtual address when in protected mode when paging is enabled. So if it is a real x86 processor, its maximum physical addressing space should be limited by its segmentation mechanism rather than paging.\"\", is it a threat?

I have no problem if the Wikipedia would rather accept a charge that a citation was never given even if the citation - in fact the total quotation of the source material, as used in the citation - was submitted three times.  This is the judgement of Wikipedia. My request is very simple. As I stand accused of \"\"original research\"\" for repeating in toto the source material (a short telegram) which was likewise published in toto in what was by every standard a legitimate source for the Wikipedia. And as I stand accused of repeated - and admittedly passionate - pleadings for the editor to check the citation, and stand accused for doing so, then all I want is to terminate my account and removed those contributions to the Wikipedia I have made.  If my scholarship is not worthy of the Wikipedia then why would you want to keep it?

Yikes.  Folken I'm not going to help you in defacing an article 3-once again, you're doing surprisingly little \"\"actual work\"\" but simply quoting rules and \"\"gaming the system\"\" without contributing much of any real value 4-Folken, I'm not going to hand you a crown for quoting rules out of context for your own benefit, nor am I taking such threats seriously.  You would use the letter of the law to destroy the spirit of the law.   5-Folken, how many times can I say this?  I'll be more direct:  you are not an Administrator, and have no real authority or \"\"sticking power\"\" to maintain a revert.  I'm going to revert your awful changes, and let me guess; you're going to revert them back and claim \"\"revert war\"\"?  Yikes.      I am not \"\"gaming the system\"\".

Or again, please prove what mistakes I would have committed, instead of blindly reverting and justifying your actions with unsubstanciated and gratuitous accusations.  1) No, making things up about the never-mentionned nationality or appearance of never-seen characters, or about the supposed lives of characters prior to the series (the dual-citizenship) that are never mentionned, is original research. There is no need of \"\"clarifying\"\" with OR a point that is self-explanatory.  2) Again, your words are not the word of God. You can use all the excuses you want, like \"\"improper english\"\", it still won't work as you are unable to prove anything you're saying. And yes, you are going to rewrite instead of remove. Otherwise, it means your \"\"proper english\"\" is just an unsubstanciated pretext. If you refuse to reword, then it means there's nothing to reword and that it's already proper english. Your bad faith accusation of \"\"defacing\"\" are considered as a personal attack. You have now been warned.  3) \"\"Actual work\"\" includes getting rid of unsuitable edits like yours. And yes, quoting rule is an important thing in WP as rules define how contributors must work on WP. So yes, correcting the edits of users like you who don't give a damn about the rules and make unsuitable edits is a huge \"\"actual\"\" work. Also, you still fail to explain what \"\"gaming the system\"\" means...Don't throw random accusations.  4) \"\"Quoting rules out of context\"\" seems to be your favorite attack. But please explain how what I said would be \"\"out of context\"\". You're quick in accusing and insulting, not in actually proving your point...And yes, I'm serious.  5) I'll be clear, VVVVV, you are not an Administrator, and have no real authority or \"\"sticking power\"\" to maintain a revert. The thing is, you're not going to revert anything, unless you've forgotten your little speech about \"\"consensus\"\" and \"\"community effort\"\"...I have not see you discussing anything about content or asking anyone's opinion. Sure, you've stated all the hatred you have for me, but it doesn't count as consensus discussion.

(I didn't mean that last part about \"\"what if I change it back?\"\" literally..nevermind).  but on to point 2:  specifically, your profile says that English is not your primary language, and you added in a sentence that didn't make sense; leading me to suspect that you are honestly mistaken.  Not in grammar or something, I mean it was confusing.  Why should I help you make a reversion I disagree with in the first place?

That is understandable as the subject is complex.   The WAGR first imported the M class Garratts, in 1911. These are very important locos, because they are the third class of Garratt to be built, and the first \"\"main line\"\" Garratt, showing the potential as a heavy freight hauler. They were followed up in 1912 by the Ms class, only difference being the Ms class were superheated. So they were also the first class of Garratts to be the subject of a repeat order. Both classes were built by Beyer-Peacock.  The Msa class were constructed in 1930 by the WAGR in their own workshops. Apparently a copy of the Ms class, they did seem to have some cosmetic differences.  The story does not end there, but moves to Victoria. The VR G class apparently is copied from the Ms class, the major difference is the frames moved outside so as to accomidate the reduced gauge. Outside framed Garratts are very rare, even in the smaller gauges. But wait there is more (no, not steak knives!). The design was used again, for the Australian Portland Cement's 3'6\"\" line near Geelong, the first loco being supplied in 1936 and the second in 1939. The boiler from one of these locos is used on the restored G42.  So in conclusion the design was constructed over a period of 28 years, used on three railway, on two gauges and built by two manufacturers, with, if I've added it up correctly, 27 locos constructed.  Personally I think the article should cover the history of the design, and include all the varients. Some work would be required to hunt down variations, though. So yes, I think it does deserve an article.  Please feel free to use the above if you wish.  Cheers,  Michael.\"\", is it a threat?

Then both Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn did anything besides commenting the film, with Vaughn even threatening the crew at the studio. After about 40 minutes from the beginning of the commentary a woman comes in the studio and tells Ben that if he doesn't move his car it will be towed. After this both Stiller and Vaughn leave the studio with almost an hour left in the film! The two men of the studio crew then, in total embarassment, put on the commentary of There's Something about Mary. This proves the complete unprofessionality of Vaughn and Stiller. They behaved awfully, Stiller, after 5 minutes of his arrival wanted to leave and Vaughn insulted one of the studio crew members and, after Thurber went away they began criticizing him.

The maps you mentioned were proven to be inaccurate and were corrected in their later versions. verified through several articles and sources.  2. The UN resolution you mentioned does not pertain to \"\"international\"\" bodies of water, but to bodies of water that are shared between two or more countries. There is a difference. For example Shat-al-Arab is a river which falls under that category. But international waters do not fall under that category and the UN geographical names committee approves the standard  international name for them.     To ralhazza.

The user was contacted and referred via previous talk message pages to point out & explain this but despite this continued to revise the page without providing references for the changes submitted.  As you have now locked the page with these incorrect/unreferenced submissions in place I would implore you to re evaluate the submissions made by user 92.8.22.187 and act accordingly.  I will go into detail here in the hope it may help resolve some the issues with the edits submitted by  user 92.8.22.187:   I see no reason to now have 4 references to support the spelling of a name that has not been contested. - One of which is a pay site and another that contains a personal address! User 92.8.22.187 claims I have been changing the spelling of the name here despite his/her addition of references. A quick look will show I have been removing the references for matters outlined above but have not in any way changed the spelling of the name here.   The reference to Payne's involvement in The Stands (5) has been changed from a full length interview with Payne about The Stands in a national publication  (Designer Magazine) to review of a solo concert written 3 years after Payne's discontinuation of the group for a local fanzine that briefly introduces Payne as a former member of The Stands before reviewing a solo performance.   Payne emigrating to US at age 13 - no reference   Edgar Jones's commitment to Paul Weller being the reason for the break up of The Big Kids - No reference - Also Jones was no longer playing with Paul Weller at the time of The Big Kids break up (Winter 2001)    The information regarding Pilgrim and Thomson's departure and the subsequent demise of the group as a result of this is wholly misleading - Pilgrim left The Stands in December - 2004 and was replaced by Graham Robinson in January 2005. The Stands then releaesed the single Do It Like You Like  which entered the UK to 40 at no 26 and was used on the worldwide Revelon London Look  campagihn featuring Kate Moss. The Stands then toured with Oasis during both their Europian tour. Luke Thompson left The Stands in June 2005 http://www.gigwise.com/news/6615/Luke-Thomson-Leaves-The-Stands and was replaced by Paul Molloy.  The Stands released Horse Fabulous in July 2005 played Glastonbury - V Festival - T in the Park - an Oasis UK stadium tour - and a headline tour before Howie Payne released a statement to say he was discontinuing The Stands in Nov 2005. All of this plus the fact that the bands label, Echo records was dissolved by Chrysalis during August 2005 is available on The Stands dedicated wiki page. To sum this up as user 92.8.22.187 has done is totally miss-leading and not based in fact. Regarding Payne's solo career the new piece mentions Payne spending time in Texas and Los Angeles with neither relevance or reference.  There is a further edit regarding Payne's name spelling and the submission implies there is a miss-spelling or changed spelling. As the only documents that are can decicivly prove the spelling of a persons birth name are Birth Certificate and Passport and none are provided here I will reserve judgement on this but I do think describing the spelling of Elliot (as here) as standard is ridiculous. There are at least popular spellings of the ame Elliott/Elliot/Eliot/Eliott/Elyott and it would seem the most popular is Elliott. I do not wish to appear to be pedantic regarding this but as this is typical of the caviler way user 92.8.22.187 has applied vague guesswork and then claimed them facts to the page in question and has accused me of changing his/her referenced submissions which is clearly not the case   I hope that as a long standing contributor to wikipeidia you can see that my aim is to prevent this page being a false interpretations of events littered with unnecessary unreferenced/POV information.  The previous page edition 01:30, 25 November 2012 has correct referenced information and I believe is a suitable and proper representation of events as per the information available at this point.

Many of the facts or generalizations are in fact opinions.  For instance, the suggestion that one million dollars is needed to live in the US without working is highly subjective.   (one could live on $500,000 quite easily, based on the average rate of return for conservative investments like mutual funds.)  Furthermore, actual cash is not necessary - many people live comfortably on businesses worth less than $100,000 that they own.  Also, using Marxist language in the initial definition shows a political POV, as in \"\"The main defining characteristic of the working class is its dependence on wage-labor (or salaried employment) as the main or only source of income, because of lack of capital assets or land that could provide an alternative source of livelihood.\"\"  In reality, one could argue that the main defining characteristic is simply whether one is in management or whether one uses physical labor or 'brain' labor.  In today's economy, it is not simply the lack of capital assets or land that may indicate working class, but also a lack of marketable knowledge.  You can own 100 acres of rural land in most US states that would be impossible to earn a living on, while having the right knowledge could earn you a living anywhere.  Finally, the alleged sexual habits of the working class (citing research 57 and 32 years old) is irrelevant to this article unless we are going to take the ridiculous practice of defining working class by their sexual habits.

The indigenous people were the Khoikhoi and the San(Capoids) who lived there for hundreds of thousand of years all alone. In the 15th century white Europeans arrived, and steadily built a civilization, dispossessing the native Khoisan. Only during the 18th and 19th centuries did the first blacks enter South Africa as settlers, invaders, and unwilling labourers. They outbred the indigenous Khoisan and the native whites to the point where the ruling white people who had built everything and anything resembling a civilisation or a modern state realised that they could lose their country to these non-indigenous people who rejected the very essence of that civilisation itself and refused to assimilate. So the official policy was apartness...apartheid. At the time everyone was happy with that, until millions more black people swet in, because their independent Black African states slid into Third World states in rapid succession. Meanwhile the local black population continued to have one of the highest birthrates in the world. The ANC, PAC, SACP etc were ALL funded by, and ruled from Soviet Moscow. The head of the ANC was never Tambo or Mandela, but rather East European Marxists. ALL weaponry, money, even idealogy came not from Soweto but Moscow. The obssessive terrorist war led to the end of white rule, and the rise of a FOREIGN-BORN black population who now represented the majority through relentless immigartion, murder, terrorism and an unnatural reproductive rate. At Mandela's inaugaration the Oppenheimers etc were there to let him know who was REALLY calling the shots. And since, \"\"independecne\"\" and black rulse, South africa has deteriorated at a shocking rate. South Africa now has the highest murder, rape, armed assault, car theft, and child abuse statistics in the world. The HIV-infection and illegal narcotics statistics are rapidly catching up. The economy is approximately 15 % what it was under \"\"deliberate discrimination\"\". There are massive blackouts every day, and the only people who are well off are the Marxist puppets who are the ANC, the druglords, and people who install security systems.

My understanding of the WP convention is that if a player is rostered with a club for any significant period of time, that club is listed in his infobox even if the player makes no appearances for the club.  If a player only passes through briefly and makes no appearances for the club, however, it isn't listed.  As for the other question, I'd say it's fairly common in the US for a player to spend a very brief period on the roster of one club before being traded to another: for instance, in the 2006 expansion draft, expansion franchise Toronto FC snapped up a couple of guys simply for their \"\"trade value\"\" and then proceeded to deal them to other teams in exchange for players they actually wanted.

Hopefully, with the great investigative work you have demonstrated here, this will send a message to these editors that their GA reviewing buddy circle is not to be taken seriously. Beyond the reciprocity of this group and their articles is the depreciated level of their reviewing knowledge. Some in this group, with or without realizing it, are responsible for the current diminished state of GA class articles. While I can't speak for each and every one of these editors, I have had personal experience with a few of them, two of which are , and .  The article Halfway Gone, which was nominated by  and reviewed by , in September 2010, was selected by myself to undergo WP:GAR. As you can see, the article clearly does not meet the WP:GA requirements. Many of the refs are duplicates of one another, including: Refs 19 and 35, 20 and 37, 21 and 33, 22 and 34, 23 and 40. There is the use of both Nielsen Business Media and Prometheus Global Media for the Billboard references. There are refs that do not support actual claims. Two-thirds of the Live performances section is factually inaccurate, seeing as though they are not live performances but instead taped and aired later that evening. My attempt at a successful de-listing of the article was met with resistance and consequently it still remains as a GA.   reviewed Howling Bells (album), an article which I nominated for GA. He quick-failed the article within 57 minutes of creating the review page. His review baffled me, it seemed as though he did not have the knowledge required to actually be reviewing an article because the majority of his claims, as far as faults in the article went, were unfounded, they simply were not true. The other points in the article he claimed as weaknesses easily could have fixed within ten minutes.  Fighting Temptation is another article that  quick-failed the day after my GA nominated article was failed by him. He proceeded to pass this article after he and the nominator came to an agreement to where he would allot a certain amount of time to the nominator to make corrections based on his GA review. David Lucas (composer) is another GA nominated article that he has had quick-failed just this week. After the nominator of that article reached out to him on his talk page stating that she could have fixed all of the issues addressed in a timely manner, he agreed to give put the nomination on hold and allow her time to make the changes. Within 48 minutes of leaving the message on his talk page, the nominator had made all the changes to the article brought up by him, and now he has passed the article that he initially quick-failed. In the past,  was warned here to stop reviewing articles and had a thread started about him and his bad GA reviewing.  In closing, I would like to say that getting any of the articles that I work on to GA status no longer is a concern to me. These editors have flooded the market with their paltry articles and now GA is not a true representation. I find it amusing that these editors still nominate their articles for GA as if it's a noteworthy achievement... it makes me ponder. They seem to not realize that their GA articles are in the same league with a C-class article masquerading as a GA. Even though my comments were a bit off topic, I would again like to express gratitude to you THR, for casting light upon this matter which needs to be properly addressed at an administrative level. This act of back scratching amongst these editors as well as their abominable reviewing standards has to cease if GA status is to exemplify what it truly stands for.  (meow) \"\", is it a threat?

I am here to try and explain something that I think you've misunderstood. The claim that I was denying peoplehood to Jews is incorrect. Those edits you've noted were, in fact, fighting a particular ANTISEMITIC person. His edits were such that he claimed Lazar Kaganovich was responsible for the Ukrainian Holodomor BECAUSE he was Jewish (and he tried to use Jewwatch as a source), tried to remove Israel from a list of countries selling pringles based on the incorrect assumption that Israel is not a country, and then went around inserting \"\"is a person of Jewish descent\"\" into articles about Jews he did not like. I was not denying Jews peoplehood, I was corecting the fallacy that Judaism is only a genetic ethnicity, which is a lie perpetrated by people like Hitler. Sposer explained it to you exactly as I would have. There are many many Jews who are not decendents of the original Hebrews. There are people who converted, people who were the product of mixed marriages in Europe, etc. They are Jews too. Concentrating on the religion aspect does not deny peoplehood, rather it eliminates the fallacy that Jews are a \"\"race\"\" only. If you would like to discuss further, please ask Fayssal for my e-mail and I will be happy to talk to you. I am doing my best to at least clear up these misconceptions.

I do feel, however, that is the only article one can talk about religion in an article about Pokémon. With the exception of the word \"\"absurd\"\" I agree with the terms.    Regarding the issue of ignoring me, I will disagree with this. I do feel that you should ignore me when I discuss religion in most Pokémon articles, but if I am not doing that, it could have detrimental consequences. I agree with The_Hybrid that the religion things has gone on long enough, ok.    Do we all have an agreement? Let's not engage in anymore vitriolic conduct, ok.   \"\", is it a threat?

JoshuaZ, where does Wikipedia's policy say that the Jacob Sheep Association = a reliable and verifiable source that Jacob Sheep are biologically primitive you hypocrite? Explain that hypocrite who personally attacked Starfire777 using lies.  Show your references JoshuaZ. Saying, \"\"Now\"\" is not a reference that your accusations are true are they? Why can't you make sense Joshua?  Again, where did those verses prophecy anything? Do these look like prophecies JoshuaZ?:  Joshua also said:  \"\"In this case, they did have sources, so you have even less of an argument.\"\"  Wrong JoshuaZ. Simply citing sources as you yourself said does not make the source valid. It must be substantiated and verifiable. Why do you conveniently forget that you smug babbling hypocrite?  Your later comments don't merit much of a response, but I wThen he said:  \"\"ill simply note that accusing people of bigotry, bias, hypocrisy, irrationality and trolling makes my earlier comment about not using \"\"Darwinist\"\" as a slur somewhat irrelevant;\"\"  Because you said so JoshuaZ, and whatever you said is true is true because you said so. So much for references eh? All you have to do is accuse and it makes you right, right hypocrite? See how you go round and round in circles using circular reasoning?  \"\"if your earlier comment toed the line, the one above crosses it.\"\"  Because you said so JoshuaZ, and whatever you say is true because you said so. Science!  \"\"I suggest you calm down\"\"  I suggest you not use sarcastic insults like that, ok hypocrite? You're implying that the Starfire777 is ill-tempered merely because he points out that you are hypocrite and uses logic to do so (as well as verifiable references on Answersingenesis.com which you lied about not being reliable and being against Wikipedia's rules to cite), ok liar?  I suggest you also not command a Christian to follow your moral standards over Christ's, over God's. He is a Christian don't ya know? Are you now God to tell him how to feel and think? I suggest you read this verse and take it to heart which millions of Christians know very well so that you learn how not to offend them again:  \"\"Be angry and do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your anger, and give no opportunity to the devil.\"\" - Ephesians 4:26-27  Last time I checked JoshuaZ, neither your nor Wikipedia's rules superceded God's.   \"\"and read the relevant Wikipedia policies and guidelines while you wait for your block to expire.\"\"  Oh the old \"\"you need to read it but I don't\"\" and \"\"you sit and think while your grounded young man\"\" insults. What an arrogant, childish hypocrite you are.  I suggest that you stop pretending that whatever you say is true merely because you said it, and again, learn what Starfire777 properly told you to learn.  I'll enhance the list for you:  Reference, evidence, truth, reality, lie, bigot, hypocrite, fallacy, circular reasoning, troll, stalking, harassment, insults, hatred, and love.

What are you references for this vague \"\"other issues\"\" JoshuaZ the Policy Master of Wikpedia?  And Joshua, who said anything about prophecies?

With frequencies from commercial loud speakers typically in the range of 30 Hz to 20 kHz, it is the lower frequency band of 30–150 Hz which is usually boosted in big music venues for enhanced effect. These low frequencies could indeed be particularly damaging to the lung parenchyma if they coincide with its natural frequency of around 128 Hz.14 Furthermore, Mahagnah and Gavriely15 showed that, in normal humans, the lung acts as a low pass filter with flat transmitted energy up to 100 Hz or 300 Hz. In view of these experimental results, the most compelling observation in our four patients is that the lower frequency band, which tends to be boosted in the kind of music they listen to, corresponds with those frequencies, thereby ensuring maximal acoustic energy transfer to the lungs.\", is it a threat?

My own view is that these places were known to most of the world by their German names for a long time, which should be explained where RELEVANT, i.e. in any historical section. This is especially true of Danzig/Gdansk, given its unique history in the interwar period and internationally high profile politically. A secondary point is that these places where known to their INHABITANTS by their German names before 1945.  There's nothing revanchist or revisionist in naming places with the names by which they were known to the world and to themselves during the historical periods involved. Indeed, it is linguistically revisionist, in a sense, to refer to Danzig (for example) as Gdansk when writing about the six centuries in which it was inhabited mainly by Germans.  I've argued all along that the Germans today should refer to these places by their Polish names when referring to contemporary events – for the same reasons that they should be referred to by their German names when historical events are the issue.      ==\", is it a threat?

That means you have to go to the third or fourth page, or go to the \"\"D\"\" listings, to see the historic district subcategory.  That sort of makes sense, but it still doesn't get it listed on the first page.  The reason I created the subcategory for houses is because there are over 3400 entries in Category:National Register of Historic Places in Massachusetts, which is absolutely huge.  I'm using Wikipedia:AutoWikiBrowser to recategorize the houses into their own subcategory, so that'll organize them somewhat better.  Eventually, I'm hoping to set up the infobox generator to check the historic function of the property, so if the function is listed as \"\"Single Dwelling\"\" (code \"\"01A\"\"), it'll automatically put the property into the houses category.  Speaking of the infobox generator, I finally had time to implement two of the changes you suggested.  I fixed the bug where seconds of latitude were being listed as 60, and I added the \"\" | coord_parameters = region:US_type:landmark\"\" parameter.

Six Photographers, an artist-initiated show that featured 200 images at a time when exhibitions of personal photographic work were rare, was regarded as sufficiently influential for the Art Gallery of New South Wales to commemorate it with a show of the same name featuring the same six photographers, more than 50 years after it had first been presented.Newton, Gael \"\"Shades Of Light: Photography And Australia 1839-1988\"\" Collins Australia, 1988 (ISBN 0732224055)Newton, Gael \"\"Silver And Grey: Fifty Years Of Australian Photography 1900-1950\"\" Angus & Robertson, 1980 (ISBN 0207141096)Art Gallery of New South Wales Exhibitions Archive AGNSW websiteAllen, Christopher \"\"Decisive Moments\"\", The Australian, 27 February 2010 The Australian website This second version of Six Photographers featured 29 images, many of them shown in 1955, and concentrated on works from the same period (the late forties through to the mid-fifties).  Candid Camera, while about half the size of the 1955 Sydney exhibition, covered a significantly wider range of artists and looks not just at the foundations of Australian social documentary photography but at the era that curator Julie Robinson clearly regards as its golden age – the fifties, sixties and seventies.  In line with the statements issued by the six photographers group, Candid Camera featured “images which appear unposed, spontaneous, or with their subjects captured unaware”. Though the majority of the photos in the exhibition (more than 80 in total) were taken in Australia, images by Australian photographers working overseas were also included.Allen, Christopher \"\"Unguarded Moments\"\", The Australian, 17 July 2010 The Australian websiteEmmett, Patrick \"\"Candid Camera\"\" ABC Television interview, originally broadcast on Stateline, 28 May 2010 ABC website Subjects included youth subcultures, newly arrived migrants, nuns, a number of prime ministers (though not all were in office at the time of the photo), musicians such as Bon Scott of AC/DC, and ordinary people in everyday settings: at work, at the beach and at bus stops.  Photographers represented in Candid Camera included Max Dupain, David Moore, Jeff Carter, Max Pam, Robert McFarlane, Mervyn Bishop, Rennie Ellis, Carol Jerrems and Roger Scott and a number of others. Of those named, all have work held in the permanent collection of National Gallery Of Australia. Mervyn Bishop is the only Aboriginal Australian to have been included, and though his work has primarily been in New South Wales, Robert McFarlane was the only photographer to be born in South Australia. In this last regard, Candid Camera was very different to Century In Focus, an earlier large-scale photographic survey curated by Robinson, which dealt only with images taken in South Australia.Robinson,\", is it a threat?

Daily Mail may not be a reliable source - There are a couple of references here that could be argued do not come from what is usually considered reliable. However, it is accepted in \"\"tabloid\"\" topics to include \"\"tabloid\"\" sources. Otherwise, Wikipedia would only consist of articles on people The Guardian writes about. Yawn!  However, these things should be adressed:  Nowhere does it actually state that Wright and Penn are famous actors. That is however necessary, because otherwise one might easily ask why this person deserves a Wikipedia article in the first place.  The archive links in the references are inconsistent. The style you should use is the one in reference #1 (Link to original page, publiser, archived from and then \"\"the original\"\" as the link). This can easily be achieved by using the cite web template.  However the first reference is not a good example alltogether, since it makes no sense that the page is from July 28, 2014 and it is stated that it was retrieved on July 19th. Please look into this.

They are no longer working together seeing as Jeff Hardy got sacked. He may be making a surprise return to the WWE in Summer or early Fall of 2006. This being because his contract is expiring on TNA (total nonstop action), so the WWE are thinking of bringing back one of the most popular ever wrestlers in the WWE. He may once again form a stable with his brother Matt and bring back the great team extreme. all the hardy boyz fans out there youll be seing them back in action before the end of the year.  lita (DDT) jeff (swanton bomb) matt (swist of fate, side effect)                edge and christian are bitches as are the dudly boys  facts jeff hardy most gamest person on tna at the moment facts matt hardy most electrifing person on smackdown facts lita most cheating woman on raw at the moment with her fucked up boyfriend edge but after its gonna be  lita with jeff and trish status and matt so r u ready for the reunited team extream matt,jeff and lita  ^^Total garbage, none of it is fact, not even decent speculation^^  Lita would not be in Team X-Treme. That would be asking for a problem.  Well as of now maybe Jeff will enter a feud with Edge and maybe get kicked off of Raw the way Matt did? Or maybe Edge will get kicked off and continue his feud with Hardy on Smackdown!  Exist 2 Inspire Edge and Lita will possibly be leaving to TNA in the future. And the Hardy Boyz Reunion has been talked about happening at Wrestlemania 23.  No Rumors.  (talk to me) (watch me)   The Hardy reunion has been finalised, they're competing together at Survivor Series, part of the team captained by Dx, along with ECW's Punk. Perhaps that should be entered into the article.   Richard   stage name   Even, and especially, if you claim that Hardy is their real last name and not a stage name, then there is an unbelievable coincidence then that they chose to be called the Hardy Boyz and not the Hardy Brothers,, the Hardies or whatever. This does not distract from their image, don't take it personally. Please explain why Hardy Boyz has no relation to anything else and was a pure creative idea.   I'm sorry if I sound rude, but do you even watch wrestling? Do you have any clue what you are talking about? Hardy is their legal last name. Matt Hardy and Jeff Hardy. So they are called the Hardy Boyz. Jeez, you would think if you wanted to edit a wrestling article, you would at least know what you are talking about. Again, sorry if you take this offensively, but its the truth.  (talk)    While you continue to ignore my argument, the argument you use is childish and preposterous and you really don't care if I watch wresting, which leagues or since when either. Whether Hardy is their real last name or not is not the issue. The facts are that  a) whether you like it or not, Hardy Boyz is a stage name, not unlike the Hart Foundation, and the Beverly Brothers,  b) the Hardy Boys existed way before the Hardy Boyz adopted this variation.  Soon your going to tell me that the name 'Hulk' in Hulk Hogan, has nothing to do with the previous usage regarding the green giant? Nobody has claimed a copyright violation, and I have absolutely no clue, and frankly wikipedia does not care, why you think that you have master editing rights on this article.   First, The Hart Foundation were called that because the real names of the characters are Bret HART and Jim NeidHART. \"\"Hardy\"\" is their legal last name. Please do some research first, since they are sometimes called the Hardy's. Maybe they chose Hardy Boyz instead of Hardy Brothers because of the books, you would have to ask Matt or Jeff that. Their real legal names are Matt Hardy and Jeff Hardy though.    If you would only listen to yourselves, you'd hear that their real name isn't 'Hardy Boyz' at all, and that they've chosen this stage name over \"\"Matt Hardy and Jeff Hardy\"\". TJ, you \"\"maybe they chose...\"\" is the whole point, you and Mike have no other clue. Whatever. Why you both think it detracts from their image is beyond me.  20\", is it a threat?

Secondly, I probably would believe such a claim if there was a in fact citation referenced in this article that is written in the English language. All we are given is an inappropriate and unacceptable reference in the form of a web page written in Russian that to English speakers, is totally useless to verify such a claim. This is English Wikipedia, not Russian Wikipedia.

These beings were referred to as EBEs (a name suggested by Dr. Vannevar Bush).  The term was first made reference to in 1986 when Jenny Randles interviewed a military soldier named \"\"Robert\"\" about some stolen Top Secret US Military papers. The term was first made public in 1987 with the release of the Majestic 12 documents by Timothy Good (a)(b):  \"\"Dr. Detlev Wulf Bronk's team has suggested the term \"\"Extra Terrestrial Biological Entities\"\" (EBEs), be adopted as the standard term of reference for these creatures until such time as a more definitive designation can be agreed upon.\"\"  (b)  In a letter to researcher William Steinman, Dr. Robert I. Sarbacher who was with the Washington Institute of Technology, confirms that some of the scientists involved in the study of recovered flying discs from Roswell were Dr. Vannever Bush, John von Neumann, and Dr. Robert Oppenheimer. (c) Steinman also discovered that one of the scientists working on saucer technology from the early days was Dr. Eric Henry Wang who became Director of the Department of Special Studies, within the Structures Division, of the old Wright Air Development Center, near Dayton, Ohio.

For the time being, I must devote my energies to the final stages of my Doctoral studies and let the fools play at being pseudo-musicologists on wikipedia. It is, however, a disgrace that the first two pages through which most online readers are introduced to \"\"the ten-string guitar\"\" (that is wikipedia and Janet Marlow's tenstringguitar(dot)com) are riddled with inaccuracies, untenable claims, and (as shown in a previous blog) even deliberate distortion of Narciso Yepes's words in an attempt to misrepresent the historical and scientific facts of the matter.  Since I've spoken out about this disinformation, I note that my main page here has suspiciously been deleted from most google search listings containing the terms \"\"10-string guitar\"\" or \"\"ten-string guitar\"\". Some of our American \"\"colleagues\"\" evidently don't like the truth coming out about their dishonest \"\"scholarship\"\".  As for wikipedia, be advised that I no longer oversee the accuracy of the \"\"ten-string guitar\"\" page and this should now be considered as unreliable as most of the other misleading ten-string guitar sites. The person presently responsible for the (from a musicological/organological point of view) misinformative wikipedia entry is Andrew Alder, whose musical \"\"expertise\"\" as far as I can gather is limited to playing drums and rhythm guitar in his local Sydney Anglican church. Yet he too deems himself an \"\"authority\"\" who is in a position to \"\"educate\"\" readers about the 10-string guitar (an instrument he has no doubt never played).    It is exactly this problem with wikipedia (that any lay person can edit it and can even become an administrator if they have too much free time on their hands and are willing to kiss enough derriere) that has caused it to be banned by universities and to be blamed for \"\"making kids dumb\"\" and for falling grades of students who turn to this misinformative online \"\"encyclopaedia\"\" for research.

Frst, your change from Bang-i-dara\"\" \"\"Bang-e-Dara\"\" wasn't properly explained.  The sources use a variety of transliterations; for example, the on-line translation uses \"\"BĀNG-E-DARĀ\"\" on the title page and \"\"Bāng-i-Darā\"\" in the text.  Is there good reason to choose one over the other?  Secondly, you seriously over-linked the article.  See Wikipedia:Manual of Style (links)#Overlinking and underlinking: what's the best ratio?:  \"\"An article may be considered overlinked if any of the following is true:  \"\"Low added-value items are linked without reason — such as, 1995, 1980s, and 20th century\"\"  I've replaced some of the goods links that you added, and I've rewritten part of the article so that the problem of transliteration choice is dealt with.   (Talk)   Hi, while I appreciate your concern for maintianing the quality of the article, I consider your reverts rather abrupt. Except for the linking of years, you do not clearly justify why you reverted other edits:  E.g. wikilinks to rationality, pragmatism, materialism, spirituality, and patriotism). Although you later re-linked England and Europe and repaired \"\"articles\"\"!  The reason for putting transliterations in Italics is to keep the reader aware of foreign language texts, which is a common practice  In your edit summary, you blame me for unsourced changes. It is evident that I did not add any new texts for which I had to provide any \"\"source\"\" but if you insist on keeping any part of text, you should provide the relevant citation  In your edit, you have linked the word Muslim with Islam which are two different articles. The use of i and e is problematic of transliterating Persian and Urdu texts respectively. But it is good practice to maintain the same standard in one article. The sound of \"\"e\"\" is common pronunciation in Urdu. And as the book predominantly contains Urdu poetry, I followed the same pronunciation pattern. Many thanks indeed for your messsage.

I wish to make an allegation of persistent Vandalism against the owner of the account ‘Signalhead’ for repeated vandalism of articles, to which: deletion of material edited into those articles which Signalhead disagrees with their being there, such contributions being legitimate edits and not vandalism in themselves (other than Signalhead unilaterally deciding that he doesn't want them there).  The articles in question are on a railway subject matter and it is clear that Signalhead has unilleterally appointed himself as an ‘expert’ who has decided to ‘own’ the articles and persistently arbitrates on what material may or may not be edited into the article.  I refer in particular to three articles, 'Home Signal'; ‘Token (Railway Signalling)’ and ‘Signal Passed at Danger’ (And I must thank Signalhead himself for providing the evidence of that last article where he tried to use a claimed erroneous edit as evidence of a false claim of sockpupetry – it has become clear that another contributor (or even contributors) feel the same way I do).  Whenever edits are made to those articles, Signalhead has often just deleted (vandalism:blanking) the edit claiming the information is just wrong or ‘erroneous’ without permitting any discussion on the point.  Further the blanking takes place anything from a few minutes to a few hours which clearly demonstrates that Signalhead is watching the articles to make sure that no ‘unsuitable’ material is placed there and to ensure that he can delete any material which he believes is incorrect.  This demonstrates an arrogant ‘know it all’ attitude to other Wikipedia contributors and is, against the principles on which Wikipedia is based.  This unacceptable behaviour brings wikipedia into disrepute by discouraging legitimate contributors from actually contributing to the content of articles.  For my own part, I specifically refer to Signalhead’s blanking of an edit at 16:44 on the 15th September to article ‘Token (railway signalling)’, with an edit summary of ‘Removed Erroneous comments …’ because he thinks he knows better (vandalised within 4 hours).  Signalhead also vandalised the article ‘Home Signal’ at 11:42 27th October 2007 when he blanked an edit from another contributor in the article with the familiar ‘Reverted erroneous edit’ justification, within 3 hours of the contribution, again because he claimed to know better.  I reverted this blanking when I added an illustration that supported the blanked text.  However, Signalhead just vandalised the article again by blanking the edit at 17:07 on the 27th October 2007 with a ‘Reverted to earlier and better version’ justification, less than 2 hours after the restoration.  Signalhead did add something to the article discussion page, but regardless of that he had no right to just blank the contribution no matter how much of an authority he thinks he may be on the subject matter.  He should have discussed the matter first and then the article should have been adjusted by consensus.  I note that another contributor has also expressed exasperation with Signalhead's persistent blanking and adjudication of article content in a somewhat more unorthadox manner.  I offer the short times between contribution and blanking and the blanking itself as evidence that Signalhead is watching ‘his’ articles and deleting any ‘unsuitable’ (in his eyes) content.  With Signalhead’s apparent familiarity of finding his way around Wikipedia, I find it hard to believe that he is unaware of the rules.  I must therefore insist that Signalhead’s editing rights be permanently revoked for the following reasons.  1.TABPersistent blanking of other contributors edits which constitutes persistent vandalism.  2.TABArroganct contempt towards other Wikipedia contributors by adopting an attitude that he knows better than everyone else (which is a clear abuse of those contributors).  Even to the extent of making false allegations to detract from his own violation of the rules.  3.TABAdopting a self appointed role of deciding what can and can’t be contributed to articles which he has decided to ‘own’ and thus …  4.TABActing in a manner to bring Wikipedia into disrepute.\", is it a threat?

In 1896, after school in Switzerland, Einstein renounced his German citizenship. Carl P. Jung was born in in the Swiss canton (or county) of Thurgau. While Jung worked on Wandlungen und Symbole der Libido (Psychology of the Unconscious), tensions grew between Freud and Jung.   Frank P. Geyer continued to serve as a detective until August 15, 1903 when he resigned. He had been transferred to the 18th Police District in the United States. Detective Geyer had arrested James Anderson; whether this is the same Anderson mentioned in Detective Geyer's 1896 work is non-determinable. In 1912 tensions between the two psychologists came to a peak. In 1901-02 Albert Einstein acquired Swiss citizenship and completed a scientific paper, obtaining a teaching position at school in Schaffhausen, Switzerland.   The FBI file on Einstein came to light in 1983 when Robert Alan Schwartz wrote an article on the subject for The Nation magazine. Between J. Edgar Hoover and John Hutchison, democratic rights didn’t stop with McCarthy’s downfall nor with the demise of so-called notorious J. Edgar Hoover. Yet for years, zero-point energy according to Hutchison is obtained from the quantum vacuum. Hutchison claims on scientific phenomena are regularly featured and discussed by various media coverage. John Hutchison's claims of inventions and discoveries of a variety of phenomena are, like, NASA. The FBI should do an article on NASA and their non-determinable webers.  I do not find it too surprising Schwartz once more wrote about not only Frank Geyer, but Albert Einstein with not too much said about Carl P.

May I draw to your attention that it is fairly obvious that those three users namely Seb az86556 , Seric2 and Chesdovi are clearly constantly creating a picture of Nicosia as a decadent muslim city that serves their religious beliefs and are all clearly hailing form Turkish backgrounds.  There is a constant undermining of the city´s Greek identity i.e. whenever a Greek flag appears in any single picture the aforementioned users delete that picture instantaneously and prefer to throw in pictures of the flag of \"\"shame\"\" and occupation that is equivalent to a legalisation of a human crime of continuous brutal occupation of the island of Cyprus by the Turkish army.  The Greek flag is OMNIPRESENT in the Republic of Cyprus whether some people like it or detest it but this is the reality and an Encyclopedia that wishes to be UNBIASED should depict the REALITY and not the subjective views of a minority of readers that are furthermore based on extremist religious and nationalistic views. On the other hand, such users do find it appropriate to throw in pictures using the Turkish and the ILLEGAL, yes illegal according to United Nation referendums flat of the non-recognised internationally illegal self-proclaimed state of the so-called TRNC.  It is totally UNACCEPTABLE to have extremist nationalistic individuals, that strategically reached the level of administrators, deteriorating all the time the article on the city of Nicosia, promoting an unrealistic Turkish character and undermining the Greek character of the city AND at the same time having an ADDITIONAL article on \"\"North Nicosia\"\" that is depicting a totally FALSE picture w.r.t the city. The TRNC is illegal, not recognised by any state other than Turkey and some terrorist states that are non-democratic and yet Wikipedia has a page on Northern Nicosia by supposedly administrators that support the unification of Cyprus. This is clearly a major distortion of their intentions and a huge lie in that an individual that pretends to be a neutral aribtrator and a supoporter of reunification cannot have a separate page on Northern Nicosia stressing how Turkish it is and then go and literally destroy everything in the proper page for Nicosia and emphasize the Turkish character of the city, talk about the tension and the division of the city all the time and undermine the Greek character.  This is clear nationalistic and racial discrimination against the indisputable Greek character of the area controlled by the Republic of Cyprus and furthermore it is downgrading for the Republic of Cyprus the mere fact that Wikipedia has a site that is CONSTANTLY vandalised by several ethnic Turkish extremists and Wikipedia users support such discriminatory behaviour.  In the light of all of this, I shall stop contributing to Wikipedia as I consider it downgrading for my own self.

That English alone was used in factor analysis also arguably demonstrates an example of ethnocentrism. Furthermore, sociologists are critical that the theory only reinforces stereotypes and ignores social factors that might have lead to traits being present in certain groups of individuals. For instance, while women have a demonstrated tendency towards agreeableness, this is likely true of most subordinated individuals. Tying this trait to women at a psychological level then only reasserts inequalities by implying that differences exist as a matter of human nature rather than as a result of the social construction of gender.\"\"  1. The information given there is incorrect. I've checked the scientific research to be sure, and English alone was *not* used in factor analysis, and the existence and nature of the Big Five factors has been validated in multiple continents. Here's an excerpt from McCrae & Hofstede's fascinating paper, Personality and Culture Revisited: Linking Traits and Dimensions of Culture (2004):  \"\"Research in the English-speaking world using the NEO-PI-R established that individual differences in the factors are stable throughout most of the adult life span; that self-reports generally agree with observer ratings; and that the five factors, as well as the more specific traits that define them, are strongly heritable. In the 1990s, researchers around the world began to develop translations 2 of the instrument, making cross-cultural research possible. A series of studies showed that much the same factor structure was found in a wide variety of cultures (McCrae & Costa, 1997), that developmental trends in the mean levels of personality traits between adolescence and later adulthood appeared to be universal (McCrae et al., 1999), and that similar gender differences were found among cultures (Costa, Terracciano, & McCrae, 2001).\"\"  Here are the relevant citations from the above; if you can find them, I suggest taking a look:  McCrae, R. R., & Costa, P. T., Jr. (1997). Personality trait structure as a human universal. American Psychologist, 52, 509-516.  McCrae, R. R., Costa, P. T., Jr., Lima, M. P., Simões, A., Ostendorf, F., Angleitner, A., et al. (1999). Age differences in personality across the adult life span: Parallels in five cultures. Developmental Psychology, 35, 466-477.  Costa, P. T., Jr., Terracciano, A., &McCrae;, R. R. (2001). Gender differences in personality traits across cultures: Robust and surprising findings. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 81, 322-331.  As a further note in this regard, one group of subordinated individuals - prisoners - show personality profiles with low Agreeableness scores. Teenagers also show lower Agreeableness than adults. So I don't think it's \"\"likely true of most subordinated individuals\"\" that they have high Agreeableness. In point of fact, it appears that Extroversion actually has more to do with social dominance than Agreeableness does. (And men score higher in the Assertiveness sub-scale of Extroversion, incidentally, as given in the last study cited above.)  2. Beyond being incorrect, I don't like the above statement because it demonstrates bias. The fact that psychometric research \"\"reinforces stereotypes\"\" does not show that the research is bad or wrong; instead, it supports the truth to these stereotypes. Whether women are Agreeable because of genetic or environmental reasons is irrelevant to the question of whether Agreeableness is a valid and universal psychomentric construct. And of course while sociologists and anthropologists may be unhappy about these research results, that doesn't change the facts.  Hopefully this explanation is thorough enough to obviate the necessity of future arguments.   22:26, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)  Clearly the point is biased in some direction; it is, after all, called criticism. However, it is appreciatable to rework claims rather than remove them entirely, as for example my move to redirect back the bias of your word \"\"discovered\"\", implying a factual truth of the matter, back to the more neutral term identified, and my return of your loaded attempt of beginning the criticism section with \"\"While the general consensus favoring a five-factor model is strong, there is still dissention.\"\"  And how was the Big Five originally constructed if not through factor analysis of personality traits from the English dictionary?

Stop being a power freak   Hi Plumcouch,  Although you are not an administrator, you seem to be a self-styled Wikipedia policeman.  I don't understand why you have been going around giving people strict instructions on what to write and what not to write.  For the Aamir Khan and Vidya Balan pages, you insist on not having links to fansites.  I don't understand why.  If you want the power of an administrator, become an administrator.  Don't take the law into your own hands.  Administrators are not the law. Admins are normal users with more abilities. See here: []  Fan sites are a big problem. First of all, most of them violate copyright laws by displaying pictures which don't have proper copyright information and strictly, those pages are not allowed to display them. If anther page (like Wikipedia) links them, Wiki can get into trouble and with it the entire project. Also, if you add one fansite, you have to add them all. Wiki is no linkfarm and not there to improve people's traffic. Add content instead of links.  Regarding the Meera Jasmine page, you are exceptionally rigid about what belongs in the page and what does not.  You want a citation for everything, and you claim that a lot of the information is not relevant on the page.  Do you want us to say \"\"Meera Jasmine is an Indian actress\"\", immediately put up a citation, scan a copy of her birth certificate and put it up there just to prove that she exists?  I don't doubt she's an actress. Google has various entries on her to prove that. If someone claims she's a devotee of Ganesha, movie xyz has been a mega-super successful film, it would be nice to add citations so you can identify such claims as not merely fangush or rumour which is very common on actor/actress pages. Lots of actor/actress sites don't have references and I admit that's still a big problem.  In the Filmography, I don't understand why you say the director and the co-star belongs in the movie's entry and not in Meera Jasmine's entry.  I'm sure you understand that the career of every actor or actress is shaped by the number of big names he/she works with, and it is a reflection of the actor's career.  So the info certainly belongs to the Meera Jasmine entry.  \"\"Big names\"\" is a very controversial topic. What's big name? Is a big name still big compared to international directors/actors like Tom Cruise or Steven Spielberg? Furthermore there have been problems with citing co-stars and directors to show that actor xyz is \"\"greater\"\" than actor abc. If you follow the edit history of actors Ajith and Joseph Vijay, you'll find a good example. In order to stop people and fans from these kind of edit wars, I think it's better to keep filmographies as simple as possible - else, things can easily be mistaken as fangush or hero glorification. Also, most actor/actress pages in the Indian Cinema Project have filmographies with just the roles and the movie - it was universally agreed upon and no one of the participants wanted to change that. If you insist upon changing the way articles at the Project should be written, you can make a formal proposal here: .  And why do you insist on creating links to pages that do not exist, such as the movie pages which do not exist?  If you insist on creating a link, you make sure the link points to something, and if a page does not exist, create the page first before pointing to it.  If you have a red link (one without an article behind it), people easily identify it as such and are generally more easily motivated to click on that link and create the article if they have seen the movies. Those red li\", is it a threat? You can choose from the following labels: \"not threat\", \"threat\"\nAnswer: [/INST]",

Let's make it simple:  According to Encyclopaedia Judaica (Jerusalem, 1972), not I, the great argument of the Reform rabbis in Frankfurt (1843) was \"\"God ordered circumcision to Abraham, not to Moses\"\"; in other words God's COMMANDMENT to Abraham is circumcision, God's COMMANDMENTS to Moses do not order circumcision; in other words:  - God's One Commandment to Abraham = circumcision.  - God's Ten Commandments to Moses = not even one for circumcision!  The rabbis, not I said so! Therefore, wholly and seriously documented, I wrote it into the main article but WP and S rub it out. This is an insane violation of the wiki rules.  Now, in order to enlighten the main article, the 2nd Commandment topic of this \"\"Discussion\"\"  introduces my \"\"discovery\"\" (a child would do it). It says:  - God's 2nd Commandment to Moses orders him: \"\"Do not circumcise.\"\"  But, contrary to the saying of PW and S, I never attributed this to the Reform rabbis.  Conclusion: who forgot to take their medicine, for several days now? Not I!  The ethical question involved about this discussion is: \"\"How can the wiki support a very obviously childish lie just because this lie has been carried along for millennia?\"\" Think about it! If you are responsible persons, you cannot publish an obvious lie without warning your readers, which I am doing.  Sigi's request to WP and S: \"\"Circumcise your heart, eyes, ears and pen, not your peco!\"\" because yes, this criminal violation of Moses 2nd Commandment is being done every day in the USA to baby boys. It even has been done to an Oregon girl, in 1950 (see http://www.aesculapiuspress.com/ - Books – The rape of innocence); indeed a good American mother cannot want her beloved daughter be deprived from circumcision when her beloved son gets it, can she?

It is refreshing to meet another Wikipedian who doesn't see any need to bite someone's head off just because of a mistake, whatever the size.  Not that most Wikipedians do that, but cordiality is still nice.  Yes, I agree that I should resist the urge to correct other people's comments.  For me, the ill will is a much bigger factor, especially because I always try to be very careful to never change the meaning of a comment, but it is still a risk, as you say.  You're right, the edits are old and the link eventually gets you there.  These are trivial changes, but I find value in them.  It is true that the servers don't spend much time on redirects, but I still would like all links going directly to the article they refer to.  Not that that will ever happen to all of WP, or even EN WP, but I can help.  Actually, I started fixing the redirecting links to that particular page because I wanted to make sure there were no double redirects, which would be a problem, and one worth fixing.  Being a perfectionist, I decided to go ahead and fix all the redirecting links instead of just the double redirects (I want a nice, clean Whatlinkshere page, with no indentions ).  A large percentage of the redirects I am fixing are on (main) namespace pages, not on talk pages, and in those cases I also fix the visible spelling of the link when it is wrong, since that should be right.  So I am doing what you were saying about fixing the article pages.  On talk pages (and even in archives), I have been fixing the appearance as well as the link target, but I think I'll change my policy based on your well-made point: I'm only going to change the link target, nothing about the appearance.  Does that seem reasonable?  I am interested in AWB, but I haven't really looked into it much.  Thanks for the tip.  My login problem is a toughie, as far as I can tell.  What happens is this: I click the register/login link at the top right of the page.  I enter my username and password.  It says I have successfully logged in, and even shows my username, etc., in the upper right.  But then, as soon as I switch to another page, I am logged out again.  I have checked my cookies, and I am accepting cookies from all Wikimedia projects that I'm working on.  It is possible it is a firewall problem, but I have no idea how to fix that.  And it isn't just at the school where I work: I can't login on computers in cybercafes in the area either.  Maybe they all have the same type of firewall or something, but I never had this problem until around December 2006, which was about the time our school changed its ISP.  I don't know if that is related, but if that is the case, it seems strange that I can't even login when I'm off-campus.  A bit of a puzzler, isn't it?  BTW, if you don't mind me saying so, I noticed that your contribs link in your signature doesn't go to your contributions page.

You stated that certain details pertaining to Bob Ross' life were not pertinent to the article. Specifically, details about his wives.  This information isn't trivial content.  Details about lots of notable individuals' nonnotable spouses permeates Wikipeda unrelentingly.  Properly sourced information about significant events in people's lives, such as marriage, divorce, births/deaths of loved ones, is not the same as saying, \"\"Bob Ross like cheese,\"\" even if one were to find a source for that statement.  Your deletion of this isnormation does, in fact, fly in the face of well-established community-driven consensus.  Examine any biographical article, and you will find lots of information, [presumably] properly sourced, that you, as an apparent deletionist, might find strictly banal and useless.  It should be noted that the details about his wives was very short, noting only their names (obviously their last names were Ross, and unless their maiden names were in a source, one could not publish it) and the durations of their marriages.  Such a short, sourced statement is surely not worth pursuing like this.  Yuor edits were reverted because you did not provide a valid reason for soing so.  As per the widely-held and practiced policy of including any properly sourced information in biographical articles mentioned above, you need to discuss first changes which go against the consensus.  There's always the possibility that you might provide convincing arguments, and even influence consensus-driven policies  but definitely not in this case.  The users who addressed your actions are well-seasoned, and are familiar with the consensus to the point of being able to enforce it on matters presicely like this without needing to query the community.  For you to be able to make the changes you made  as I said  you must discuss it first.  Making changes that violate policy can easily be construed as vandalism  it suggests that you either didn't read or care to abide by the community standards  but that is incorrect.  The policy of vandalism states, in part:Any good-faith effort to improve the encyclopedia, even if misguided or ill-considered, is not vandalism. Even harmful edits that are not explicitly made in bad faith are not considered vandalism. For example, adding a personal opinion to an article once is not vandalism — it's just not helpful, and should be removed or restated.It appears to me that you indended to be helpful, as a deletionist, but it flew in the face of established community consensus and policy.  I will remind those editors who made those comments to you about vandalism the specific of policy, but the bottom line is: do not remove properly sourced information from Wikipedia without prior discussion.  This is really not a matter of needing to arbitrate, because this is a matter of content dispute, which whould be discussed on appropriate talk pages. -  talk \"\", is it a threat?

For a long time the article stood on its legs because I, as Entwistle's biographer (the book is on its way), VERIFIED the sources. For example (and I'm only going to give two for now), you deleted the entry mentioning her signing the RKO contract on June 13....I HAVE THE CONTRACT IN FRONT OF ME! I'd be happy to send you a scan of it. At the top it says, \"\"This agreement made this 13th Day of June, 1932, between RKO Studios and Peg Entwistle.\"\" It is signed by Entwistle, David O. Selznick, and Daniel L. Oshea, Selnick's Assistant Secretary. Then you added that Entwistle played in bit parts in several films (I'm paraphrasing), and referenced a source. But this claim of bit parts in other films proved to be untrue when I researched the entire body of RKO's inter-office memos at the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences archives in the Herrick Library in Beverly Hills. (I have copies of all the Selznick and Cukor memos regarding \"\"Thirteen Women,\"\" and other possible Peg Entwistle-related projects (such as discussions regarding Billie Burke wanting Peg instead of Katherine Hepburn in \"\"Bill of Divorcement.\"\" (Would you like to see them, too?)

I tried to be polite and respectful and reasonable, but it turns out that you are entirely unwilling to discuss anything with regard my expertise into the career and life and death of Peg Entwistle before \"\"tweaking\"\" her Wiki.  Entwistle's familynamely her brother Milton Entwistle and his daughterfurnished me with hundreds of documents including diaries, letters, and telegrams. Before I met them I spent 5 years researching her careerliterally reading the era's newspapers and theatrical-related periodicals a page at a time. I spent hundreds of hours doing interviews. I found Entwistle doing radio in 1925, having lunch at the White House in 1931, being black mailed, and a dozen other things no onenot even her family had known. And because of her family's cooperation, I was able to complete a timeline that other authors had never before been able to string together. EVERYTHING I discovered has at least two verifiable, reliable sources.  Wiki editors Rossrs, and Wildhartlivie, and I spent weeks \"\"tweaking\"\" the  Entwistle articleit wasn't perfect, but it was good enough for them and so it remained good enough for Wikipedia until you came along and decided you knew more about her than her biographer.

Like \"\"breast enhancement\"\", and \"\"aesthetic mammoplasty\"\", the phrase \"\"breast augmentation\"\" is a plastic surgery industry buzzword and constitutes clearly promotional spin-doctoring.  This article needs to use more neutral, purely descriptive terminology like \"\"breast enlargement\"\", \"\"cosmetic mammoplasty\"\", \"\"voluntary mammoplasty\"\", etc., without implying any value judgment pro or con (and there are many with \"\"con\"\" views on this topic, both male and female, for a number of reasons ranging from medical and psychological to aesthetic and religious; this article inappropriately minimizes this fact in favor of plastic surgery marketing). — ''''''   Talk⇒ ʕ(Õلō)ˀ  Contribs. \"\", is it a threat?

Earth is the only place in the Solar System where liquid water is known to exist at present. The other 29% is made of rocky land in the shape of continents and islands.  Earth interacts with other objects in the Solar System, particularly the Sun and the Moon. The Earth orbits or goes around the Sun roughly once every 365.25 days. One spin is called a day and one orbit around the Sun is called a year. This is why there are 365 days in a year, but a leap day is added once every 4 years.

Instead you write \"\"I think the misunderstanding is that PBS assumes that the word patriot has only positive connotations.\"\" Whether at the time people use the term patriot to mean a supported of the Good Old Cause or something else, its usage today implies someone who supports their nation, and if it is to be used before the UDI, then what does it mean as (the nation did not exist)? @ your argument \"\"The British colonists had made North America their country\"\" is I think flawed unless you think that Virginians somehow changed from being patriots to rebels between the 1770s and the 1860s. Surly in both cases they were either rebels or patriots, unless one is using the terms inconsistently. If they were rebels in the 1860 then why not use the term for the 1770s as well? Luckily one can usually substitute the word \"\"Confederate\"\" for \"\"rebel\"\" so this is not usually a POV issue for civil war articles (but using the word patriot in an article has POV connotations). For example in the main body of the text the first use of the term Patriot is in the sentence \"\"The landing of this tea was resisted in all the colonies and, when the royal governor of Massachusetts refused to send back the tea ships in Boston, Patriot mobs destroyed the tea chests\"\". In what way were the mobs patriotic? Even the phrase \"\"rebellious mobs\"\" would not be accurate. \"\"anti-tax mobs\"\" would be more accurate, but it is probably better just to drop the adjective completely from in front of mobs.      \"\", is it a threat?

I have divided both the pages under discussion into two parts. One for Government point of view and one for refugee point of view. Since there is no neutral or united point of view, I will not be editing or discussing in those pages as actively as I have been doing. Besides, I can not prepare for my exams with no other than my fellow South Asian accusing me of fancy accusitions in place no other than wikipedia. Here is something that I have to say as regards your recent posts in this page:   About: Eukesh, you say all the right things, that we need a neutral article, that you want to be constructive, but at the end of it, it seems your mind is closed. You say you have not read the garbage from the nepalese press but that you have done a lot of research on the internet. isn't that where all that garbage is available? you say you want to be constructive but you are already fixed in your view that all the ethnic nepalese people in the camps are from bhutan. FYI, if they’re not from Nepal, it could be they are from india also, ie, not necessarily from Bhutan. being 'stateless' is not such a big thing in this region for which someone HAS to be blamed. you can count the number of poor nepalese without any documents who are finding their way to india every day. if ever there was a census to be done between nepal and india, you will find millions ‘stateless’ by your definition, definitely in the hundreds of thousands. is bhutan responsible for that? is it inconceivable to you that some of them might have made their way to bhutan? You conclude that it is 'entirely a Bhutanese issue' and nothing could be further from the truth. If nepal wasn't quite the economic basketcase it has become, maybe the rest of us in the region wouldn't have to deal with such an outflow of emigrants from your country.   About:  \"\"You say you have not read the garbage from the nepalese press but that you have done a lot of research on the internet.\"\"   Please do not comment about Nepalese press in a nation where it has played a major part in bringing a revolution from a nation where there is virtually no press. The press here is not garbage. However, I did not care about the Bhutanese refugee case until I found that it was missing here and thought of writing about it.  About:  \"\"You say you have not read the garbage from the nepalese press but that you have done a lot of research on the internet. isn't that where all that garbage is available?\"\"  Wikipedia is available in net. Do you call it garbage? I have cited the information from sites of globally accepted bodies and not from the sites hosted by some pro- or anti- groups or some blog pages  About: you say you want to be constructive but you are already fixed in your view that all the ethnic nepalese people in the camps are from bhutan. FYI, if they’re not from Nepal, it could be they are from india also, ie, not necessarily from Bhutan. being 'stateless' is not such a big thing in this region for which someone HAS to be blamed.  I do not have a point of view. I agree that I have made some points which were offensive to some, but it was not intentional and were derived from the data. There was a speculation which was corrected later. I just posted what were there in websites of UNHCR and other global organizations which is something that is done in wikipedia. I have told you that people of Nepalese origin are found throughout the world. Many might be stateless. However, the reports of UNHCR shows otherwise in case of Bhutanese refugees. If you can change their view, please do. Otherwise stop editing with whatever you wish to write or in your own words, stop garbaging wikipedia.   About \"\"being 'stateless' is not such a big thing in this region for which someone HAS to be blamed.\"\" Well, there is nothing which can top this sort of irresponsible comment.   you can count the number of poor nepalese without any documents who are finding their way to india every day. if ever there was a census to be done between nepal and india, you will find millions ‘stateless’ by your definition, definitely in the hundreds of thousands. is bhutan responsible for that? is it inconceivable to you that some of them might have made their way to bhutan?

There are many different opinions on their racial makeup. One opinion among some scholars is that ancient Egypt was a multi-racial society. Another opinion held by other scholars is that that ancient Egyptians were black African peoples, claiming that this \"\"black identity\"\" was strongest in early Egyptian history and waned over time.

There also appears to be an agenda here, being pushed, often through tag-team and uncivil retorts, on this talk page. Wiki seems to turn more into 4chan and less from an encyclopedia through the manipulation of \"\"not censored\"\" rhetoric, each day. I'm waiting for a photo of a \"\"sheep shagger\"\" to appear on Welsh or Scottish article, under the guise of \"\"notability\"\". Some editors here have serious pro-gay COI/POV issues and need to step back, especially given that this is supposedly a heterosexual activity also and straight people are being accused of \"\"homophobia\"\" out of turn. Why is the solo female fister a cartoon, and the male fister a photo, for a start? Not very neutral. Why does there even need to be a photo, when all the article needs is a description – I mean, it's hardly rocket science, and that guy hardly has a \"\"rocket\"\" worth shouting about? You don't need a photo on how to boil eggs, so why one here? Again, it's anti-Wiki content that brings the entire project into disrepute with regards to making it less accessible to kids, more agenda/politically motivated, more pornographic, less educational, detrimental to every other article/contributor who wants to see Wiki develop. Sadly, it is forced issues like this that lead to conflicts regarding discrimination. Gays complaining about homophobia if the photo is removed are hypocrites, when they themselves use \"\"not censored\"\" as an excuse to discriminate against younger readers. Age discrimination is no less prevalent than sexuality discrimination. Photos such as this are what lead to the Foundation considering an \"\"image filter\"\" recently. I'm pro-LGB (-T) but I also believe in \"\"behind closed doors\"\". And I disagree with anyone who says kids won't look it up. When I was young kids looked \"\"dirty words\"\" up in the dictionary. Now the internet is here, and images like this only serve to corrupt young minds. Let's put it this way: because of \"\"no legal threats\"\", no LGBT members stand a chance of forcing a legal discrimination matter out of this. COPPA stands a better chance, as child protection is of far greater importance than censorship, where there is limited parental control. WikiKamaSutra anyone?  [Chat • RFF] \"\", is it a threat?

It comes off more like an academic discourse on the incorporation of multiple characters and changes from previous franchise entries in video games, using Mother 3 as an example, than a proper encyclopedic entry. I won't quickfail just for this, but I do want it fixed before I'll pass. I'd prefer the section to be rewritten entirely, but some glaring points follow: \"\"Mother 3 is presented in eight chapters with rotating player-characters including the protagonist's \"\"cowboy father\"\", the \"\"family dog\"\", an \"\"inept thief\"\", and \"\"abused monkey\"\"\"\" - So is the protagonist not playable? How large is the party? Why are these descriptions in quotes? - it suggests equivocation in your understanding of the characters. Actually, why isn't the protagonist named in this section? Again, I completely understand the desire to approach this from an out-of-universe perspective, but only to the point where the prose doesn't trip over its own detachment. \"\"Mother 3 begins with naming the members of the player-character's family along with questions of the player's favorite food and \"\"thing\"\",[3] and opens to a \"\"pastoral forest village\"\" soon interrupted by a forest fire and the Pig Mask Army, who impose police state-like conditions on the village.[2] With the fire's outbreak, the father ventures out to protect his family (twin sons Lucas and Claus and wife Hinawa), but the rest of the world is eventually implicated in the plot.[1] They set out to take down the Pig Mask Army.[4] Lucas, the game's hero, does not become prominent until the fourth chapter. The game features a lighthearted plot, with enemies like \"\"partying ghosts\"\" and \"\"talking rope snakes\"\".[5] Porky, a character from EarthBound, appears as the leader of the Pig Mask Army and is the game's main antagonist. In addition, other EarthBound characters, such as Dr. Andonuts and Mr. Saturn, also appear.\"\" - Why isn't this stuff in Plot? The cast of characters does need to be introduced better, but jamming plot details into Gameplay isn't the way to do that. The second paragraph is better; it's more in line with what I expect from a GA gameplay section. At least, it's good until \"\"Apart from this rhythm and combo mechanic, the battle system is similar to that of its predecessor.\"\" What's the predecessor's battle system like? Remember, not everyone reading this has played EarthBound. \"\"There is no need to grind for experience and it has no random battles\"\" - First of all, this should start off with a \"\"However\"\" or something of the like as its predecessor does have those things. The information is also lacking, though - why isn't there a need to grind for experience? I think of this as one of the central, love-it-or-hate-it JRPG mechanics, and I'm curious as to how the genre might work without it. Imagine reading a Pokémon game article that simply states that you can change your party as needed (which is unusual for a JRPG) without giving a brief overview of how the PC and Day Care systems work - that's how I feel reading this. \"\" and lets the player see their magic \"\"PSI power\"\" abilities\"\" - Viewing your abilities probably isn't a necessary gameplay detail, but why isn't there anything on the abilities themselves and their use in battle? And do they have uses outside battle, like HMs, Rock Smash, Secret Power, and Softboiled do in Pokémon? \"\"While Mother 3's music is both similar in tone to its predecessors and completely new, it features similar sound effects.\"\" - By \"\"completely new\"\" do you mean it isn't recycled wholesale, or that the style is somehow new? Also, this bit probably doesn't belong in Gameplay.  If you're up to rewriting this, which I encourage - especially if you're shooting for FA - I'd recommend a structure like the following: Paragraph 1: It's a top-down JRPG, there's an overworld, you explore towns with your team of characters, yada yada yada. Paragraph 2: There are battles, they're not random (with an explanation of the conditions under which you do encounter battles - is it like in Pokémon Colosseum where you only fight other Trainers, or like in Dragon Ball Z: Buu's Fury where you can see the enemies on the overworld before fighting them?), this is how the battle system works, this is how items work, this is how experience points/leveling work (again, how is this the case without grinding? Or is a different system used entirely?). Paragraph 3: Your team consists of such-and-such a number of characters, they change with different events in the story, characters do/don't return once they leave, here are examples of the characters and how they differ in and out of battle. Stuff like items and saving (can you save anywhere?) - work in wherever you want; I'm not picky.   21:47, 25 September 2014 (UTC\", is it a threat?

SkagitRiverQueen making unfounded accusations I have had to deal with this person continually since before Christmas. Someone posted questionable content to her talk page, whereupon she intitiated an unfounded sock case against me at Wikipedia:Sockpuppet investigations/Wildhartlivie/Archive. Then she filed a report here about me. Next she popped up at Black Dahlia, an article upon which she had never previously edited, to revert something I removed and has maintained a overly long, ridiculously drawn out discussion with editors there. At one point, Crohnie admonished her for treating her like \"\"an idiot or something\"\". Next she popped up at Charles Manson, also an article upon which she had not previously edited, to throw herself into an issue I was involved in and making unsupported statements, which she has proceeded to edit war over. She then joined WP:CRIME, a project in which I'm active. It is quote obvious she is stalking my edits. Finally tonight, another editor came to Talk:Black Dahlia to enter a content vote, and SkagitRiverQueen made an outright accusation against me of canvassing votes, where she clearly and unequivocably said \"\"It's obvious that some editors have been canvassed specifically to sway the vote (and am I making an accusation here? yes, indeed, I am).\"\" I asked her to withdraw her comment and her response was \"\"And, frankly, regardless of whether or not I can prove it, I don't believe that you *haven't* canvassed for input here.\"\" She was clearly challenged on this by LaVidaLoca here and Pinkadelica here. I want this editor to stop following me around, picking tenditious arguments and making specious and unfounded accusations against me. Wildhartlivie (talk)   I endorse these comments by Wildhartlivie. I object to the specious claim that my opinion was canvassed in anyway and believe SkagitRiverQueen's intent is tenditious and assaultive in nature. For the record, she has reverted the Manson article 3 times, even after she was asked not to edit war over it. It appears to me that she is wikihounding Wildhartlivie and would take exception to anything she says or does. This is an untenable situation that needs to stop. LaVidaLoca (talk)   As the editor who instigated the preliminary consensus vote (and as such a possible cohort in the WP:CANVASS), I must agree that this claim against Wildhartlivie is specious and unwarranted. I have attempted to instruct SkagitRiverQueen on the proper way to engage in disputes (mainly not attacking other editors based on perceived editing style). This has not worked as of yet. I do see a pattern of \"\"wikihounding\"\" here on SkagitRiverQueen's part, as do many other editors, and this has persisted for some time. This feud must end... Doc9871 (talk)   IMO, this is purely retaliation by Wildhartlivie for the sock-puppet investigation (exactly why it's the first thing she mentioned in the complaint even though the issue has been over and done for nearly a couple of weeks, now). Not only is she reverting practically everything I have edited recently, she is now reverting entire sections of large articles I have edited[18]. On top of that, she continues to call me by an inflammatory name (\"\"Skag\"\" - I have noted on my User Page it is *not* an acceptible contraction of my user name; she even mentioned earlier today that she has read that admonition on my user page[19] that is a known slang term for women who have less than savory reputations[20]). Now, in addition to everything else, she has placed an \"\"edit war\"\" warning on my talk page *after* she filed this report.[21] I am not in an edit war - and am actually trying to reason with the editor of that article who has been reverting my recent edits.[22] Wildhartlivie has publically called my mental and emotional health into question here in Wikipedia on more than one occasion. Additionally, she has a questionable history that includes abuse of her rollback privileges (see User talk:Wildhartlivie for the warning she recently received and User talk:GTBacchus for her responses to the warning), continued incivility to anyone who edits articles she watches, and canvassing her Wikipedia friends to back her up whenever her edits or actions are called into question (above content from LaVidaLoca is proof of this). And yes, I do believe she canvassed editors by email regarding the issue we have been discussing at Talk:Black Dahlia. Concerning this complaint, you will likely also hear from User:Doc9871, User:Pinkadelica, User:Crohnie, User:Rossrs, User:Vidor, and User:Equazcion - all editors she has canvassed in the past when she feels she needs support in one of her efforts to prove me wrong. Evidence of this can be found at [23], [24], [25], [26], [27]. In those instances, she out-and-out lied that I mentioned four of those editors in any fashion - yet, her\", is it a threat?

I am contacting you because you are one of the editors/admins who is still active now, and was aware of the notoriously disruptive editor User:Betacommand, a.k.a User:Δ (Delta). As you probably know, he was eventually banned after a third arbitration case, due to the way he conducted himself in the pursuit of his main interest on Wikipedia, WP:NFCC enforcement.  What you may not know, is that he has evidently returned and has been editing as User:Werieth since 2012, in violation of that ban. After just a year, Werieth is already causing the same sort of disruption that Betacommand did - you may experience some deja vu by reading reports made about Werieth such as the one at the top of this AN archive. There are already several others. A quick perusal of Werieth's contributions will also reveal the same Betacommand-like self-assured approach, grounded in the belief that their edits are always \"\"100% correct and 100% according to policy\"\" (when the reality was that he made basic errors and pushed policy boundaries at a rate that, while acceptable in ordinary users for a time limited period, was found to be unacceptable in an editor with the edit rate and communication issues Betacommand had, especially given their inability to change)  I and others have already tried to expose his return via these sock puppet investigations, although as you can see, it's not getting far. That's not for the lack of an answerable case though - you can see the latest summary in this post. Most of the obstruction can be put down to the usual dysfunctional and counter-productive aspects of Wikipedia governance, which of course will always aid experienced WP:GAMErs like Betacommand.  But you may or may not be surprised to learn that the people obstructing this investigation the hardest are three admins whose own conflict of interest with regard to Betacommand/NFCC is best demonstrated in their own words - Black Kite (repeatedly deflects attention away from Werieth and onto accusers), Kww (blocks accusers, and has already unblocked Werieth once) and Future Perfect at Sunrise (has basically declared all out war on anyone who even whispers that Werieth might be Betacommand).  The purpose of this post is to raise awareness about his return, and hopefully persuade one or more of you to resubmit that SPI with the evidence I'm sure you will be able to compile using your own knowledge of Betacommand's characteristic traits. At the very least to prompt you to put his talk page on your watch lists and regularly review his contributions (although obviously, don't waste your time trying to deal with any issues you see on the flawed basis that he is just any old user).  Also obviously, you should also raise a red flag every time you see one of those three admins trying to further suppress the inevitable exposure of his ban evasion. If his return is to be covered up for an unnecessarily long time, it should at least be done simply through general incompetence, rather than obvious COI based abuse of the tools/trusted position of admin. A few emails to the arbcom members who dealt with Betacommand also probably wouldn't go amiss - if ordinary admins aren't bothered about this particular user's return (and you will remember, blinded by their enthusiasm for having someone, anyone, perform NFCC enforcement edits, a great many of them were unwilling to even admit his particular approach to that necessary work was a problem),   Betacommand's clandestine return to Wikipedia is bad enough as it is given that he has simply resumed where he left off in the NFCC enforcement field, with several users already having wasted a lot of time having to deal with him as if he were a legitimate user. But obviously the nightmare scenario if the cover-up is allowed to continue for another year, is if Werieth/Betacommand decides script assisted batch editing is not fast enough for his liking, and decides to take an altogether faster approach - possibly even trying to [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&diff;=prev&oldid;=43661105\", is it a threat?

I particularly like the four waves and will incorporate that in my modus operandi. I wish I had more time to edit, although that is not my calling, yet I'd love to help. Here I am just trying to keep my two Cuba books (I'm the author) in the further reading sections... Yes, another self serving bastard. For me it is difficult to stay on top of this alone. I do have several questions that you certainly could answer, yet if you will is another matter entirely.   1) When there is no further reading section, should I A) create one or B) add the information in the reference section (I feel that may be a faux pas)or C) do something else like ... run Forrest run?    2) Unfortunately I have not had anyone write a bio for me... yet. I'm afraid I am responding at a poor time because while I usually dominate Google searches with my books, interviews, and my Blog at Sulekha, at the moment I am a distant second on the first page. Sadly, I share the name of Charles Spencer King with the inventor of the Range Rover.... This confuses many a seeker as you might imagine. Regrettably, Mr. King (the other) died in the last month, and that has thrown the proverbial monkey wrench into the rankings (Addendum: I assure you I am alive and well).      I would love to at the very least get into the Disambiguation section, however I am afraid I would need a bio for that.... Am I correct?    3) For some reason my ISBN does not seem to work here despite the fact I am on everything from Amazon through the Library Thing....and everything between. Odd, yet I would be delighted if at the very least I could get this to go to either the individual page at Amazon or the title page ( this one:)    http://www.amazon.com/Charles-Spencer-King/e/B002ELIWKI/ref=ntt_athr_dp_pel_1   Thank you in advance for your valuable time and expertise.

And I don't wanted to offend or hurt somebody feelings. If so I'm sincererely apologize. I just wanted to investigate. And make improvements of english wiki. ... But I must say, that you, Sjones23, is quite double-faced, you change your opinions often. You sating and agreeing that plot of \"\"PM\"\" is complicated and complex and after one day you saying that it is not so. You should not do this. Or this means can't to come to an agreement.  You said:\"\"Let's hope there are no more edit wars based on misunderstandings.\"\" But if you will go from one side to another... I hope you understand. So I just kind advice to watch and keep your words. And don't forget what admin Bbb23 said to you:\"\"I strongly urge Sjones to stay away from the article for a while to prove his good faith\"\". I believe that you are respected editor, but everyone can make mistakes and so on. Rules, guidelines, etc, are only one side of a coin. Well, I hope we understand ech other. Again I'm saying I don't want to offend somebody, just saying my sincere vision and opinion. Maybe some roughness...   TheFarix, really I didn't undersand totally. You mean that there is fixed order in categories? I read that rule, but didn't understand it completely. Will be glad if you can explain. Thanks.   Sjones23, about your sand-box version of plot. I must say that I don't like it and reasons I telled earlier. Look, you write, for example:\"\"After Ashitaka returns the head to the deer god, the land becomes green again, and the accursed and lepers are restored to health. San and Ashitaka part, vowing to see each other as much as possible, while Ashitaka, finally freed of his curse, decides to rebuild Tataraba. Eboshi vows to rebuild Tataraba along more harmonious lines,...\"\" - what I see there it's completely muddle, misinterpret, lie. This is rough OR and distortion of what we really see in the film. I hope you will understand. And much places in your sand-box version like this example. So I disagree, must decline your version. Reread please what I wrote to Elen about different variants (point two).

In Graham's case his masonic credentials are not what \"\"make him notable\"\". It does not really matter what Graham may have valued or what he was proud of... What matters is what sources (such as historians) think is of value.  If there are sources that discuss his Masonic credentials, and talk about how they affected Graham's life and his achievements, then he would be Categorized.  The truth is, being a 32nd degree Mason is not that noteworthy... any 3rd degree Mason can become one... all it takes is paying an initiation fee, and spending one afternoon watching the degree ceremony being performed as a play.  In fact, you don't even have to take the 4th - 31st degrees as a prerequisite (you can jump right from being a 3rd degree to being 32nd).  Now, if Graham had been a 33rd degree things would be a bit different... that degree is somewhat rare and is a special award given for service.   As for being elected Master of a lodge, even that is not that notable... most lodges elect a new Master every year, and since there are tens of thousands of lodges in the US alone, this means that there are literally hundreds of thousands of Past Masters in the US.  In smaller lodges, it is not uncommon for every member of the lodge to have a turn as Master.  Now... if Graham had been elected Grand Master of an entire Masonic jurisdiction things would be different... state or national level Masonic office is somewhat notable (there are only hundreds and not thousands each year), and that is the level of notability that deserves categorization.

Until and unless a fully balanced viewpoint is presented (ofcourse in compliance with WP:BLP) in the article, the tag cannot be removed.

Even the famous Pope Paul VI quote that traditional Catholics always cite uses this terminology: “There are those who ask what authority, what theological qualification, the Council intended to give to its teachings, knowing that it avoided issuing solemn dogmatic definitions backed by the Church's infallible teaching authority. The answer is known by those who remember the conciliar declaration of March 6, 1964, repeated on November 16, 1964. In view of the pastoral nature of the Council, it avoided proclaiming in an extraordinary manner any dogmas carrying the mark of infallibility.” (General Audience, December 1, 1966, published in the L'Osservatore Romano 1/21/1966)    \"\", is it a threat?

My concern is to find language that reflects the fact that there are more than a handful of exegetes that maintain that the doctrine of the Trinity is contained in the Scripture of the Old and New Testament. They would admit, of course, that the term \"\"Trinity\"\" is not in the Bible and that the doctrinal formulas of later ages are not stated point blank. Yet they see the Scripture as a whole confessing one God, while confessing the Father as God, the Son as God under names such as \"\"The Angel of the Lord\"\" and the \"\"Word of Yahweh\"\" and the Holy Spirit as God. To me, \"\"some\"\" gets to that. Without extensive research, however, I cannot say how many feel that way.

It is too short to accommodate a medium height individual without the bending of the knees, a technique not practiced in Egyptian burial, and no lid was ever found.  I never heard about the sarcophagus being too short, this is certainly not generally accepted knowledge. Also, there are many other presumed items missing, such as the portcullis blocks (alleged remnants are left), some kind of slide connecting gallery and ascending passage, entrance blocks and the entire floor of the queens chamber. Keep in mind that the pyramid was open for centuries with no guards whatsoever-only immovable or almost immovable structures remained until the first attempts to a professional description of the interior more than 3000 years after construction.  Egyptologists suggest the chamber was intended to be the original burial chamber, but that King Khufu later changed his mind and wanted it to be higher up in the pyramid.  The 'change in plans'-theory has been suggested by some, but AFAIK is rejected by contemporary egyptologists such as Lehner and Stadelmann. Instead, they suggest an intended unfinishedness for religious purposes.  The Greeks believed that slave labour was used but modern Egyptologists accept that it was built by many tens of thousands of skilled workers.  Not \"\"the Greeks\"\", but Herodot writes about slaves, a myth which seem to be ineradicable. He visited the pyramids 2000 years after the construction and beside naming the builders correctly, had not much of a clue about anything else.  The Great Pyramid is the only pyramid known to contain both ascending and descending passages.  I'd say the satellite pyramid of the bent pyramid counts, too. It has a remarkable similarity to the great gallery as well. Minor point, I know.  The National Geographic Society filmed the drilling of a small hole in the southern door, only to find another larger door behind it.  I know Hawass said that during the show, but no other egyptologist believes that. Look at the images yourself. There have been no further attempts made to \"\"open\"\" the alleged door. I'd say, don't call it a second door until proven otherwise. The shafts seem to end in this tiny room-a very similar structure can be found in the southern upper shafts as well, by the way.  Joyce Tyldesley states that the Great Pyramid itself \"\"is known to have been opened and emptied by the Middle Kingdom\"\"  I wonder where Mr. Tyldesley got that information from. I am not aware of any ancient source regarding the opening of the pyramid. While I believe it has happened, and during the first intermediate period, there is nothing but vague hints in old egyptian sources-I think the term \"\"known\"\" is exaggerated. Herodot and Diodor claim to have been inside-that points to the pyramid being open around 450 bc, but at which point the opening happened remains uncertain.

The user  may not understand that the Kvens are indigenous to Northern Norway, in my view anyway, and many of the best experts seem to agree.  We are not moved by the personal assumptions and/or believes of the user , but science instead, of course, as you seem to agree.   The user   Please read the related writings from this column's archive.  The Norse are not indigenous to the extreme Northern Norway of today.  The Kvens are.  The Northern Norway's Tromsa area alone has at least 12 prehistoric Kven place names.   Historians and linguistics experts have been able to come to this conclusion, for instance based on the words and spellings that were used prior to the time - and/or during the time - when the first Norwegian/Norse immigration to Iceland took place.  The relevant sources have been given in this forum, for instance KVENLAND / KAINUUNMAA, 1986, by the Professor Emeritus Kyösti Julku.   Where are your sources for counter claims, user  ?  Do we only have your personal narrow view point, which even appears to be based on no sources at all.  If there are sources behind your views, what are they in relation to this matter for instance ?   The related and quoted experts - earlier mentioned in this forum - are not basing their views only on the writings of Ottar, or Alfred the Great, or Tacitus, or any other before mentioned or not mentioned historian, or other scientist, writer or leader alone, of course.  Ask yourself for instance, who might be behind the prehistoric jewelry hidings that have been discovered only recently from Inari, not that far from the coastline of the Arctic Ocean.   Examine and read more.  Only after having done that, make your own conclusions, not before, please.  In the meanwhile, let the experts make their conclusions, based on all the material and sources they have available.  Wikipedia is here to reveal the findings of science, not the opinions of yours.     It is generally accepted that the Sami people are the indiegenous poeple of Northern Norway. I am aware of the history of this article. If you read the article you will notice footnotes such as this: A reference. These are the references for the paragraph you are reeading. When you click on one you will get the reference list. A link is provided for most articles. I suggest you read the article being referenced, and either start discussing my interepretation of the refered article, or the content of the refered article. For the later you need to provide your own references.    User Labongo:  Your view is not a \"\"generally accepted\"\" view at all, but only your view.  We hope you agree, that it is not reasonable to request for us to have to provide evidence to everyone separately.  Please check the archive for the beginners.   There is a reason why we are asking for the exact quotes and exact - easily verifiable (as Mr. Mikkalai put it) - book and page information from you.  The reason is, that simply showing a list of authors and books proves nothing.  Wikipedia's vandals and foul players are known to resort to exactly this sort of tactics.    Once again:  The sources offered do not agree with the text written in the Kven article !  To understand this, you only have to read the last comments by the user Drieakko''.  As everyone can see, he continues backing up from his statements.  In different ways, he goes on appologizing, while he attempts to round of his false statements.  What does that prove:  This is only a learning processs to him.  He really doesn't have anything to contribute to this topic, except for chaos !   User Labongo/Drieakko:  It is your job to show where exactly someone - a respected and known historian or other scientist - agrees with your text.  The burden of proof is in your hands to show evidence.  Please, include exact quote(s) and page information.  That is how Mr. Mikkalai wanted to proceed, after a recent concensus was reached.   We are quite familiar with the related material in question.  We have provided our sources in detail, you have not, not even a single quote with a matching book and page information.  - - Steve Wondering   Please stop pretending that this article has no references.

Sweeps helps to ensure that the oldest GAs still meet the criteria, and improve the quality of GAs overall. Unfortunately, last month only two articles were reviewed. This is definitely a low point after our peak at the beginning of the process when 163 articles were reviewed in September 2007. After nearly two years, the running total has just passed the 50% mark. In order to expediate the reviewing, several changes have been made to the process. A new worklist has been created, detailing which articles are left to review. All exempt and previously reviewed articles have already been removed from the list. Instead of reviewing by topic, you can consider picking and choosing whichever articles interest you.  We are always looking for new members to assist with the remaining articles, so if you are interested or know of anybody that can assist, please visit the GA sweeps page. In addition, for every member that reviews 100 articles or has a significant impact on the process, s/he will get an award when they reach that threshold. If only 14 editors achieve this feat starting now, we would be done with Sweeps! Of course, having more people reviewing less articles would be better for all involved, so please consider asking others to help out. Feel free to stop by and only review a few articles, something's better than nothing! Take a look at the list, and see what articles interest you. Let's work to complete Sweeps so that efforts can be fully focused on the backlog at GAN. If you have any questions about the process, reviewing, or need help with a particular article, please contact me or  and we'll be happy to help. Happy editing!  (talk • contrib)\", is it a threat?

You nominated it under A1 (no context) and A3 (no content), but the article isn't really that close to meeting either criterion; it's pretty clear what the subject of the article is, and it isn't actually empty.  If there are other reasons to delete it (there certainly may be), feel free to bring it up at AfD, but just having little content or no references isn't enough for CSD on its own. Thanks,  ⚇♔   complaint I'll be making  complaint about you @MrScorch, @RHaworth and @Cindamuse. Collectively your actions are pack-dog style harassment and vandalism. Hopefully at the end of complaining about your actions, articles as popular as Sumo (which collectively bring in about 1 million hits a year) will not be treated with contempt, based on ignorance, by administrators, like @MrScorch, @RHaworth and @Cindamuse.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)    I am in no way affiliated with the dispute over this article, I was just warning you about removing articles for deletion notices/tags by following Wikipedia policy. Also, please sign your comments.     I had already been warned by @RHaworth and @Cindamuse. You are the 3rd to warn me after RHaworth's vandalism. To warn somebody three times by different moderators/administrators after the event, is harassment by the moderators/administrators.

Some Wikipedia editors are holding to views about the contras that even the Sandinistas don't believe anymore.  For instance, while pro-contra editors like to emphasize the role of the MILPAS, anti-contra editors prefer to emphasize the role of former Guardsmen. Yet even Envio, in its February 1987 review of the contra war, noted that Dimas' MILPAS rebellion was \"\"the most serious episode\"\" of the early part of the war.  On the other hand, your favored version reads that \"\"many members\"\" of the old Guard were involved in forming early groups like the 15th of September Legion. But even writers who were hardly pro-contra, like Christopher Dickey and Roy Gutman, have noted how tiny these groups were.

It is also rather obvious about the romantic Pocahontas connection to ideas of Roanoke survivors, in discussions of Virginia.  These things are dismissed as fancy, but they are distinct beliefs of those who attempt to put a face on what the Melungeon community has had as an inception.  So you see, I am an extreme skeptic to the fantasies described by ignorant rednecks...but I do in fact think they are relevant to the beliefs of those promoting the Melungeon identity.  One need not endorse a belief of association, but merely allow others to see what sort of identities Melungeon life has acquired.  I am confident to declare that there is so much myth obfuscating the reality of what life is like in Appalachia.  Appalachian culture is from the Deep South to Maritime Canada.  Melungeon culture is centred on the Gulf coast and south of Bermuda on the Eastern seaboardoriginally Spanish areas.  People think that just because impoverished Scotch-Irish on the frontier dressed in buckskin and furs, that they were some \"\"noble savages\"\" (though they were not Cherokee, but in fact Andrew Jackson's henchmen).  So many ideas here wreak of Crank (person) nonsense.  Are you the spin doctors making apologetics for the Antebellum South, by having it seem like the perpertrators are actually descended from the victims?  Are you sitting in a trailor right now, trying to deny your Jerry Springer lifestyle?  Civil War's Reconstruction is a real bitch?!  That white Spanish territory is the Melungeon core, in true history.  See here: Hispanics contributed Melungeon heritage, via Louisiana and Florida colonies.  This was much different from slave owners who raped slaves to make more slaves.  Melungeons were basically the first Hispanics in the United States, whom often lived in secret or adapted to Anglo ways.  Please, do not spread fantasies as facts in this article!

There is a reason newbies are reluctant to become regulars on Wikipedia and most editors that have edited Wikipedia for as long as I have, just basically retire and walk away. What is funny is that during the asteroid re-direct discussions of March and April I was not even around to discuss the consensus that developed. I did not make a single edit to Wikipedia from March 5 to May 1. It will be a great loss to Wikipedia content (vs the wiki-police force and policies) if editors like myself leave because members such as Padenton are allowed to group attack people without bothering to properly look into the facts.

How do the registries \"\"enforce\"\" these requirements?  2) Could you state what testing organization(s)are accepted by each registry for these \"\"passing\"\" grades?  Your \"\"grades\"\" indicate they are probably OFA scores, but how are Penn-Hip scores treated in the registries, since this testing is also being used with Shiloh Shepherds, from what has been previously mentioned in this discussion?  3) What are your references for your gathered information; that is to say, what are the web page addresses for the various registries where this info is stated as required/enforced/recommended?  4) Most importantly, since the term \"\"required\"\" calls for a resource by which adherence to this \"\"requirement\"\" can be enforced, could you also please provide  the resources through which interested puppy buyers can confirm testing results for the individual dogs (or their parentage) they are interested in purchasing.  Whether claimed as required or not by whichever registries or breeders, these claims have no value (other than through \"\"blind trust\"\") to potential puppy buyers unless they have an opportunity to verify the results themselves through independent means.  In other words, if a reader wants to research the hip \"\"grades\"\" of the parents of a puppy they are considering buying (not generic group testing results) would you please indicate where that information can be found for each of the registries (NSBR, ISSR, TSSR)?     Example:   NSBR - Hip registration is primarily through OFA.

You see, the nature of fiction is that it's not necessarily coherent. Since this article is not about Malcolm Wilkerson in the first episode of the show \"\"Malcolm in the Middle\"\" but about the character throughout the show, it is indeed inaccurate to use a name for the character that was only used for the pilot episode. For the entire rest of the seven season run, the character's name was only \"\"Malcolm\"\". This is not a question of beauty or taste, but of plain accuracy. A title like \"\"Malcolm (XXX)\"\" my appear clumsy, but Wilkerson is not an alternative. In my opinion. If can't build consensus on this between the two of us, I suggest asking for additional input at Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions, since I didn't find anything in the guidelines for a specific case like this (although I'm fairly sure the fact that the character's name was \"\"Wilkerson\"\" only during the first of 151 episodes of the show means that calling the character \"\"Wilkerson\"\", esp. in the title, is inaccurate). —'''''' \"\", is it a threat?

Since there was no time to build up the match it was decided to do a screwjob finish, and then build to the rematch at Superbrawl the next month. So benoit \"\"won\"\" the match(with Sid's leg clearly on the ropes), and then the next night on Nitro the decision was overturned. The official result of the Sould Out 2000 Main Event was \"\"Chris Benoit and Sid Vicious fought to a no-contest\"\". End of story. Except not. Pissed off at the shitty booking, Benoit confronted booker Kevin Sullivan(who benoit had a personal history with re: Nancy). Sullivan then told Benoit if he didn't like the booking he could ask for his contract release no questions asked. benoit took him up on it and jumped to the WWF. The difference between this and the millions of other screwjob/Dusty finishes was that rather than the belt seemingly moving from one champion to the next, then being handed back....the bgelt was vacant before Benoit \"\"won\"\" the title, thus the overturning of the decision made the belt vacant once more. Sid also had a seeming title victory only for the result to be overturned due to his \"\"pinning the wrong Harris\"\". Officially at the time the belt went from Hart to a vacant state to Kevin Nash awarding the belt to himself........  Okay, so Vinnie Mac has bought at WCW and recognised both Benoit's and Sid's first wins as World Title Wins. He has also recognised Hulk Hogan's two AWA Dusty Finishes as official World Title Wins. I don't like it, but I guess it's official now. The obvious question is, since Vince owns WWE, WCW, ECW and AWA can he, say overturn David Arquette's WCW World Title win at this point?
