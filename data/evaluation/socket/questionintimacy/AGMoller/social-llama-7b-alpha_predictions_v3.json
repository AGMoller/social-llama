The use of the same words to describe both events (e.g. \"explodes\", \"affect\") also creates a sense of similarity or parallelism between the two situations, which can be interpreted as a more intimate connection.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the level of intimacy can vary depending on the context and the audience the sentence is intended for.
