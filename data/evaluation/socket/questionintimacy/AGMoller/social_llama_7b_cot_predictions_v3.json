I would rate the level of intimacy of the item \"a common, everyday item that would confuse someone the most from the middle ages\" as \"Somewhat-intimate\".\n\nIn the middle ages, people were largely unfamiliar with many of the everyday items that we take for granted today, such as toothbrushes, toothpaste, deodorant, and antibacterial soap. These items were not invented until much later in history, and they would have been completely foreign to people living in the middle ages.\n\nOther items that might be considered somewhat intimate in this context include things like toilet paper, tampons, and sanitary pads, which were also not invented until much later in history.\n\nI hope this helps!
