Some meditate, some exercise, some talk to a therapist, some take medication. You may need to try several approaches before you find one that works for you. If you haven't tried meditation, I would highly recommend it. There are many apps and resources available to help you get started.\nAs far as becoming confident, it's important to remember that confidence is not something you either have or don't have. It's a state of mind that you can cultivate through positive thinking and self-esteem. It's also important to remember that everyone feels nervous or anxious at times, and that it's normal to feel self-doubt. The key is to not let anxiety stop you from living your life to the fullest.\nGood luck on your journey to mental health!\n\nComment: Thank you for the answer!

I'm thinking Buster Keaton could've played a pretty good Bruce Wayne, for instance.

I guess it depends on the individual's responses, and how they answer the question.\nI personally wouldn't share this with people I don't know very well, and would probably only answer this question for people I know very well, or if I trusted them. It depends on how open you are about your personal life, and how willing you are to share your thoughts about that.\nSome people may not share this information, and that's okay. It's just a question, and everyone has different boundaries about what they share and what they keep private.\nSome people may also choose to share this information, and that's okay too. It's up to the individual to decide what they're comfortable sharing, and how much they're willing to open up about their thoughts and feelings.\nI think it's important to be respectful of other people's boundaries, and to not pressure them into sharing something that they're not comfortable with.

People who don't like talking about their genitals may not want to answer, but those who are comfortable with that level of intimacy may answer.\nIt's also an issue of body function, so it's not really any different from asking how someone wipes their nose.\n\nComment: I guess there's no way to know if the person who asked it is actually curious, or just gross. It could be either. It's pretty intimate, but only if the person who asks wants to know.\n\nAnswer: I would say it is very intimate.  It involves asking someone about something most people would prefer not to share, and it requires some degree of comfort with the person asking.  (If you are not comfortable with your own body functions, you probably don't want to discuss them with others.)\n\nComment: I'm not comfortable talking about body functions, but I think this question would be pretty intimate for a lot of people.\n\nComment: @user20586 - I think this is one of those questions",

I guess some people would feel it's more offensive than others, but it doesn't seem to be more intimate. I don't think it's very intimate at all, and I don't know if anyone would feel that it was.\n\nComment: I agree with your assessment.  I think it is offensive because of the connotation of female genitalia, which is a very personal and private part of a person's anatomy.  But it doesn't really have anything to do with the actual act of cussing.  I'm not offended by cuss words, but I don't use them, except for very rare occasions.  I find them coarse, and not something that one would use in polite company.  I think this is true for most people, even though some people are more sensitive to them than others.  I think it's a matter of personal taste.\n\nComment: @Steve I agree. I don't think it's the word so much as the",

Some people are addicted to drugs, or alcohol, or food, or sex. I don't think I would mind too much if someone told me they were addicted to something. But it depends on the person, and what the addiction is. Some addictions are more acceptable than others. I've got nothing against people with addictions, but it can be a bit of a difficult thing to talk about. It's not really something that most people like to talk about.

I'm 18 years old and never had this problem before. I've tried everything I can think of but I still can't get rid of it. It's driving me crazy!\n\nComment: I'm not sure what to make of this. Is there anything else you can tell us? I know it sounds very intimate, but do you have any other symptoms? What is your daily routine?\n\nComment: @Matt No, not really. I don't have any other symptoms. I just wake up with a hard on sometimes and I can't do anything about it. I'm pretty sure it has something to do with the hormones but I don't know what else to do. It's not a huge deal most of the time, but sometimes it gets in the way and I just wish there was something I could do about it.\n\nComment: I guess I'm wondering what",
