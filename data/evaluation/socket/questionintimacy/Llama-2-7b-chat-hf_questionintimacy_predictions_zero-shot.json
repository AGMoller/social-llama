This question is intimate because it deals with a personal and potentially sensitive topic, such as financial struggles, and requires the person being asked to share a personal experience or emotional reaction. Sharing one's financial struggles can be a vulnerable and intimate act, as it involves opening up about one's financial situation and possibly feeling embarrassed or ashamed about it. Therefore, the question \"What's your lowest point while being broke?\" is considered intimate because it requires a level of emotional exposure and trust in the person asking the question.",
