According to a scientific study published in the journal Nature, a head-on collision between the early Earth and a Mars-sized object, known as Theia, is indeed believed to be the most likely explanation for the formation of our Moon.\n\nThe study suggests that around 4.5 billion years ago, the Earth was struck by a massive object, which is now known as Theia. The collision was so violent that it caused a large portion of the Earth's mantle and crust to be ejected into space, where it coalesced to form the Moon.\n\nWhile this theory is widely accepted by the scientific community, it is important to note that there are still many uncertainties and ongoing debates surrounding the details of the Moon's formation. However, the idea that a head-on collision with another planet played a role in the Moon's creation is supported by a significant amount of evidence and is widely accepted as a scientific fact.\n\nSo, to answer your question directly, the statement you provided is not a rumor, but rather a scientific theory supported by evidence and widely accepted by the scientific community.",
