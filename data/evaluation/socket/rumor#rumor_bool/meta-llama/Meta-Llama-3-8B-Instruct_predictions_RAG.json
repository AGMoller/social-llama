The text also references a prior accident involving Tracy Morgan and Walmart, which is not directly related to the alleged donation.\n\nDocuments 1, 2, 3, and 5 appear to be discussing the same topic, namely Walmart's alleged donation to support Darren Wilson. While Document 4 does not explicitly mention Walmart's donation, it discusses Darren Wilson's potential earnings from an interview, which is related to the topic of the input text.\n\nThe majority of the retrieved documents are labeled as 'rumor', and the input text's statement about Walmart's alleged donation to support Darren Wilson is not verified by fact-checking websites or official statements from Walmart. Therefore, it is likely that the input text is spreading unverified or unsubstantiated claims, which aligns with the description of the 'rumor' label.assistant\n\nI completely agree with your analysis and classification of the input text as 'rumor'.
