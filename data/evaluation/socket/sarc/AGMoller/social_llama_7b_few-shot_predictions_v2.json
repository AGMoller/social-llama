Neoconservatism is a political ideology that emerged in the United States in the 1960s and 1970s, and it is characterized by a strong belief in the importance of American leadership and intervention in global affairs.\n\nSome people may argue that the Gatestone Institute is a Neocon think tank because it has been critical of Islamist movements and has advocated for a more robust American foreign policy in the Middle East. However, it is important to note that the Gatestone Institute also publishes articles and analysis on a wide range of other topics, including immigration, national security, and human rights.\n\nUltimately, whether or not the Gatestone Institute is considered a Neocon think tank is a matter of interpretation and opinion.

Here are some possible meanings:\n\n1. Literal meaning: In this case, the speaker is simply stating that they are accompanying someone, and the phrase \"I'm with ***HER***!\" is used to indicate their presence. For example, \"I'm with my wife at the concert!\"\n2. Sarcastic meaning: The phrase \"I'm with ***HER***!\" can also be used sarcastically to express annoyance or frustration, especially if the speaker is not actually with the person they are mentioning. For example, \"Oh, great, I'm with my favorite person in the world... not.\"\n3. Ironic meaning: In some cases, the phrase \"I'm with ***HER***!\" can be used ironically to convey the opposite of what is actually true. For example, \"Yeah, I'm with my ex-girlfriend at the party... just kidding, I'm alone here.\"\n\nIn conclusion, the meaning of \"I'm with ***HER***!\" can vary depending on the context and the tone used.

However, I can provide you with some context and analysis of the sentence you provided.\n\nThe sentence \"Good thing we have Trump and not the candidate who would have led us into WW3!\" is a complex and controversial statement that could be interpreted in different ways.\n\nOn one hand, it could be seen as a sarcastic commentary on the current political climate and the perceived threat of war under a particular political leader. The use of the phrase \"good thing\" suggests that the speaker is expressing relief or gratitude that a particular outcome did not occur.\n\nOn the other hand, it could also be interpreted as a statement of fact, acknowledging that the current political leader has taken actions or made decisions that have prevented the outbreak of war. In this sense, the sentence could be seen as a straightforward expression of appreciation for a particular political outcome.\n\nWithout further context or information, it is difficult to determine the exact tone or intention behind the sentence. However, I can tell you that it is important to approach political discourse with respect, empathy, and an open mind, and to avoid making sweeping generalizations or assumptions about political leaders or parties.",
