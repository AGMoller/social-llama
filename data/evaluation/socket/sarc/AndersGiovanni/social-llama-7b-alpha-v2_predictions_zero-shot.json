I think most of them were in the Revolutionary Communist Youth Brigade (RCYB). I don't know why they called themselves \"Irakcommunist\" except that maybe someone thought \"Iraq\" would make them sound internationalist. I guess it's kind of like the name of some group in the 1930s who called themselves the Communist Party of Germany. They were really called the German Communist Party but they dropped the \"German\" part in an attempt to seem more international.

The Wampa is a snow monster who traps Luke in a cave and Luke struggles to free himself. The reference is to the scene in which Luke frees himself and climbs out of the cave. Luke is described as having been in the cave for some time, possibly several hours, so the reference to chills is to the relief that Luke feels when he is able to free himself.\nThe reference to Luke in the Wampa cave is a well-known and iconic scene from Star Wars and the reference to Luke's chills is intended to be a metaphor for the relief Luke feels when he is able to free himself from the Wampa. The comparison to Luke's struggle against the Wampa and the relief Luke feels when he is able to free himself is meant to be a way of describing the emotional impact of the scene on viewers.\n\nComment: Sorry, no, not sarcasm.

I'm not sure how mystical it could be if it was fabulous and terrifying, unless it is mystical somehow? I guess you could say mysticism is magical?\n\nComment: @Obiwannabarakirken it is a very subjective thing.  Some people believe in the supernatural, some don't.  To some, the supernatural is not a magical force, but a spiritual force.  Others see magical powers as supernatural.  To others, supernatural means not of the natural world, but super above nature.  So, no, not all supernatural forces are magical.  Some people don't believe in magic.  Others believe in magical forces as being supernatural.  It all depends on what you believe in.",
