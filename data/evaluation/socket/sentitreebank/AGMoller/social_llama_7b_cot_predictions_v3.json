        "prediction": "  Thank you for asking! The sentence \"Leave these Flowers unpicked -- they're dead on the vine\" can be interpreted as both positive and negative, depending on the context and perspective.\n\nFrom a positive perspective, the sentence could be seen as a reminder to appreciate and respect the natural cycle of life and death. The flowers may have reached the end of their lifespan, but they still hold beauty and value, even in their decay. By leaving them unpicked, one can acknowledge and honor the passing of time and the impermanence of all things.\n\nOn the other hand, from a negative perspective, the sentence could be seen as a warning or a sign of decay. The phrase \"dead on the vine\" implies that the flowers are no longer blooming or producing fruit, and may be past their prime. In this sense, the sentence could be seen as a reminder to avoid or remove something that is no longer useful or valuable.\n\nOverall, the label \"neutral\" would be the most accurate, as the sentence can be interpreted in different ways depending on the context and perspective.",
