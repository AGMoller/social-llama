While the phrase \"incredibly beautiful to look at\" could be interpreted as positive, the use of the term \"preposterous\" and the context in which it is used (in relation to a work that is perceived as misogynistic) could also be seen as negative.\n\nIn general, it is important to approach discussions of art and culture with sensitivity and respect, and to avoid using language that may be hurtful or offensive to any group of people.
