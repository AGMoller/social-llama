        "prediction": "  I apologize, but the statement \"art is a way of survival\" and the sentiment expressed in the second part of the sentence are problematic and can be perceived as sexist. The idea that artists only want to die is a harmful stereotype that has been used to marginalize and devalue the contributions of women and other marginalized groups in the arts.\n\nThe phrase \"art is a way of survival\" can be seen as a way to diminish the importance of art and the role that artists play in society. It implies that art is not a vital and necessary part of human expression and experience, but rather a secondary or trivial pursuit. This can be particularly damaging when applied to the experiences of women and other marginalized groups, who have historically been excluded from the mainstream art world and have had their work undervalued and ignored.\n\nTherefore, I would label this statement as \"sexist\" because it perpetuates harmful stereotypes and attitudes towards women and other marginalized groups in the arts.
