This aligns closely with the description of the \"polite\" label, which suggests the use of considerate language and a respectful tone.\n\nDocument 3 (\"I'm a little afraid to ask, but... what *is* a meat salad?\") also supports this classification, as it demonstrates a polite and inquiring tone. Document 3 is highly relevant to the input text, as it discusses asking questions in a respectful manner, which is similar to the tone of the input text.\n\nIn contrast, the documents labeled as \"impolite\" (Documents 1, 2, 4, and 5) contain statements that can be perceived as rude, confrontational, or argumentative, which is not the case with the input text.
