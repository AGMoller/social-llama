Illegal abortions can be dangerous and can lead to serious health complications, including infection, heavy bleeding, and even death.\n\nIt is important to recognize that access to safe and legal abortion is a fundamental right and is essential for women's health and well-being. The World Health Organization (WHO) and other medical organizations have emphasized the importance of safe abortion services, which are essential for reducing maternal mortality and morbidity.\n\nIn terms of statistics, the WHO reports that approximately 22 million unsafe abortions occur each year, resulting in the deaths of thousands of women worldwide. This highlights the urgent need for increased access to safe and legal abortion services, as well as comprehensive reproductive healthcare.\n\nIn conclusion, the emotion associated with the term \"backdoor abortions\" is not joy or optimism, but rather sadness and concern for the safety and well-being of women.

The use of the hashtag #theoldsideshift and the mention of \"humans of late capitalism\" suggest that the speaker is feeling frustrated or annoyed with the way things are going, possibly in relation to the shift of shaft abrasions from panties.

The use of the term \"fake outrage\" and the emojis 🤣 can be perceived as dismissive and disrespectful towards people who are expressing their genuine concerns or emotions. It is important to acknowledge and validate people's feelings, rather than dismissing them as \"fake.\"\n\nInstead, I would suggest rephrasing the sentence to be more empathetic and respectful, such as: \"I understand that you are upset about this issue. Can we find a way to address it together?\" This approach acknowledges the person's feelings and shows a willingness to listen and work towards a solution.",
