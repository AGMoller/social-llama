Wow, no wonder so many people are so depressed. ;-) Seriously though, no emotion, just fact.\n\nComment: @Mak: haha, fair point! But I did say neutral factual statistic, not neutral, neither positive nor negative. But you are right, it is neutral. The only emotion might be sadness if someone is depressed, but not necessarily, as there may be no emotional response at all.\n\nComment: I think the neutrality of the fact is what makes it sad for someone with depression. It just makes it more difficult to get help if the medical profession doesn't recognize the problem. If you are not feeling sad, it's difficult to talk about it. I think the neutrality of the fact also contributes to the feeling of hopelessness. I'm not sure if that makes sense. I think you would have to have been there.\n\nComment: @BillWarner: very good points. I can see how the neutrality of the fact could be a problem for someone depressed.",

He is a true legend and will be missed.\n\nComment: @Darren - I'm not a Leeds Rhino fan but I feel a tinge of sadness at the loss of Danny McGuire. I think it is more than just a professional athlete retiring. I remember hearing of his courage when he played the last game of the season despite knowing he had a broken foot. And his career was full of achievement. And that's what I miss, not so much the Leeds fan. I'm not a rugby fan. I've no connection. Just sadness at the loss of an inspirational sportsman.

The RAC is known for being pretty bad, but this is unacceptable.\n\nAnswer: frustrated and worried\n\nComment: Agreed, frustrated and worried.

The RAC's call centre staff should be trained to deal with these calls appropriately. I would have been shouting down the phone at them.\n\nAnswer: frustrated and worried\n\nComment: I've just phoned them and they say there is nothing they can do and I should phone my insurance company.

I don't think so. Maybe you can get away with that but I think everyone has at least a bit of nervousness especially when playing competitive sports. You may not know it but you do. I think it's called adrenaline. It makes you nervous. I think your body tells you when you are nervous.

What makes you think that it's a nightmare? Why not a night terror? Just curious. :)\n\nComment: @Toneiris I guess it is more likely to be a nightmare because of the use of the word \"Nightmare\" itself. Otherwise, it could be a night terror as well. However, as I said, it is only a guess. The OP did not specify what kind of a dream it was, only that it was a bad dream. So, we cannot be certain about what kind of a dream it was. But since the OP did not specify it, we have no other option but to assume that it was a nightmare. That's my take on it, at least. :P\n\nComment: That's fair enough.

It has no meaning other than what the individual feels it is. So it is not possible to quantify it, or even define it. It is a feeling that we can only experience ourselves, and it cannot be communicated to another person. In this case, the person says that he was \"lost in her bliss\". That is, he was so overwhemled with the feeling of bliss that he was lost in it, and it seemed like he was in another place altogether. It is not possible to know what that place was, or what it felt like.
