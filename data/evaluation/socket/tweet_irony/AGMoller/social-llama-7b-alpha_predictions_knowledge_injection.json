        "prediction": "  Hello! I'm here to help you with your question. Based on the information you provided, I would label the sentence \"Lol everyday excuse the language #relationships #men #women #irony #lotd\" as \"irony\".\n\nThe use of the phrase \"Lol everyday excuse the language\" is a common way to express humor or sarcasm, which is the opposite of its literal meaning.
