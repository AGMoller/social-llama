Based on the information provided, I would classify the use of the label \"extended cut\" as ironic.\n\nThe term \"extended cut\" is typically used to describe a version of a film that has additional footage or scenes that were not included in the original theatrical release. However, in this case, the sentence is referring to a trailer for a film called \"NICHA\" that was released in 2014. The use of the term \"extended cut\" in this context is ironic because the film has not been released in an extended cut version.\n\nTherefore, I would label this sentence as \"irony\".",

Are they trying to convey a different message?\n\nIn the case of your sentence, I would say that it is a bit of both. 🤔 The use of the phrase \"I literally do not care\" is quite ironic, as it implies that the person is being completely uncaring or apathetic, but then they follow it up with the phrase \"at all.\" It's almost as if they're saying, \"I don't care, but I also care so little that it's not even worth mentioning.\" 😂\n\nSo, in this case, I would label the sentence as \"irony.\" The person is using language that is opposite of what they actually mean, which is a common trope in irony. 🤝\n\nI hope that helps clarify things for you!

The disaster occurred in 1984 when a gas leak at a Union Carbide pesticide plant in Bhopal, India, caused thousands of deaths and injuries.\n\nThe irony lies in the fact that the disaster was a result of delayed justice, as the company responsible for the leak, Union Carbide, was initially slow to respond to the incident and failed to take adequate measures to address the consequences. The phrase \"justice delayed is justice denied\" is often used to describe situations where justice is not served in a timely manner, but in this case, it is the opposite - justice delayed led to a massive tragedy.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"justice delayed is justice denied\" in the context of the Bhopal disaster is an ironic statement, highlighting the tragic consequences of delayed justice.",

In this case, the fact that someone is getting cooked breakfast suggests that they are being taken care of or treated well, which is the opposite of what might be expected if they were \"up to something.\" The use of the phrase \"defo up to something\" adds to the irony, as it implies that there is something suspicious or unusual going on, even though the context suggests otherwise.\n\nSo, based on the given information, I would label this statement as ironic. 😊",
