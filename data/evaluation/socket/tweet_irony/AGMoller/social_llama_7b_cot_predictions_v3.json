Based on the information provided, I would classify the use of the term \"extended cut\" in the sentence as ironic.\n\nThe term \"extended cut\" is typically used to describe a version of a film that has been edited or expanded beyond the original theatrical cut. However, in this case, the film being referred to is a trailer, which is a short preview of a film that is typically used to promote the film and generate interest among audiences.\n\nAs such, the use of the term \"extended cut\" in this context is ironic, as it implies that the trailer is a longer or more comprehensive version of the film, when in reality it is just a brief teaser.\n\nSo, the answer is: \"irony\".",

Specialization refers to the idea that individuals should focus on a particular area of expertise and pursue it with great depth and skill, rather than trying to be jack-of-all-trades. While this concept can be applied to various professions, it does not necessarily apply to strippers.\n\nStrippers are professionals who perform sexualized dance and other forms of entertainment for an audience. Their work requires a unique set of skills and talents, and they are not necessarily in need of a college degree or any other type of formal education. In fact, many strippers are highly educated and come from a variety of backgrounds.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"most strippers belong right where they are #nocollegeneeded #adamsmith #specialization #strippers\" is not ironic, as it does not accurately reflect the reality of the stripping profession.",

Irony: The use of the hashtag \"#not\" after the phrase \"Thanks for pirating my music!\" could be seen as ironic, as it suggests that the speaker does not actually mean what they are saying.

It allows individuals and groups to express their opinions and bring attention to issues of public concern, without fear of retribution or reprisal.
