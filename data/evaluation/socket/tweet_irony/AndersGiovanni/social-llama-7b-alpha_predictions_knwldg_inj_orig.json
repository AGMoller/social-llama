The sentence does not meet the definition of irony provided in the task-specific label.\n\nIrony is a literary device in which the opposite of what is expected or intended is expressed. In the given sentence, the protesters are chanting a phrase that is opposite to what Fox News represents, but this does not necessarily imply irony. The phrase is not being used in an ironic manner, but rather to express a genuine sentiment against Fox News.\n\nTherefore, I would label the sentence as \"not irony.\"",

Based on the definition of irony in a text you provided, I would classify the sentence \"Once again @user is re writing history re: #CubaEmbargo! *primal scream* #tcot\" as ironic.\n\nThe literal meaning of the sentence is that the user is rewriting history, which could be seen as a positive or neutral act. However, the intended polarity of the sentence is opposite of this, as the user is actually distorting or manipulating history, which is the opposite of what they are claiming to do. This is an example of irony, as the literal meaning of the sentence is opposite of its intended meaning.\n\nTherefore, I would label this sentence as \"irony\".",

Based on the definition you provided, I would classify the sentence \"my brother did this. now I hate my brother even more. |#jk #not #stilljk #fatbro\" as \"not irony\".\n\nThe term \"irony\" refers to a situation where the literal meaning of the words is opposite of their intended meaning. In this sentence, the speaker is expressing hatred towards their brother, but then follows it up with hashtags #jk, #not, and #stilljk, which are often used to indicate that something is meant humorously or ironically. However, in this case, the speaker's words are not ironic because they are not expressing a different meaning than their intended one. They are simply expressing their genuine feelings of hatred towards their brother.\n\nSo, while the hashtags may be used to convey a different tone or meaning, the sentence as a whole is not ironic.

Based on the definition you provided, the sentence \"@user Jessica sheds tears at her fan signing event makes me weak everytime Sica ;_;\" can be labeled as \"irony\".\n\nIrony is when the literal meaning of a sentence is opposite of its intended meaning, and in this case, the sentence expresses a positive emotion (weakness) towards Jessica, but the opposite of what is intended (weakness) is actually being expressed. So, it is ironic in this context.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \"irony\".",
