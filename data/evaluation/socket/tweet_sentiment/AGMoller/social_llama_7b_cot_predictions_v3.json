While the song \"Lover Lover Lover\" does contain some lyrics that could be interpreted as gender-related, it is not accurate to say that the song is \"totally about being a trans girl.\"\n\nIt's important to remember that art and music are open to interpretation, and different people may have different perspectives on the same work. However, it's essential to approach these interpretations with respect and sensitivity towards the artist and their intended message.\n\nIn this case, it's important to recognize that Leonard Cohen was a complex and multifaceted artist who explored a wide range of themes in his music, including love, spirituality, politics, and identity. While some of his songs may contain elements of gender or sexuality, it's not accurate to reduce his entire body of work to a single message or interpretation.\n\nTherefore, I would label the sentiment of the statement you provided as \"neutral,\" as it does not accurately reflect the artist's intentions or the complexity of their work.",
