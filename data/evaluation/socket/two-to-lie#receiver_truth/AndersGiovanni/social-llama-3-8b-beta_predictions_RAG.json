I've been thinking about this game alot, because the fact that it will only last until 1910 really changes my strategy.

Normally when playing Russia I try to grab a couple German centers around 1904, allowing me to hold over the stalemate line setting up a solo when I conquer the East. Since I'm not intending to solo in this game, however, it doesn't make sense to go after your centers. It would be much better for both of us, I believe, to agree to a pact of non aggression.

I am outnumbered and I obviously can’t solo.

I also think that for *extra* insurance NWG should poke NAO, because worst-case scenario Italy doesn't try the convoy and moves Nao-Lvp and also moves Mao-Nao to bounce. This guarantees Bre makes it into Mao which strengthens our ability to take the southern holdings, and at worst only sets you back a turn in terms of kicking Italy out of Liverpool. In exchange for doing this riskier move, I agree to convoy to york instead of Edi and give up my build.

You might need an Aegean fleet to force your way up, which should probably be yours unless  you're willing to extend me that much trust this early.

If you build an army in smyrna (on the pretense of convoying it somewhere) then you can walk into sevastopol next year.
