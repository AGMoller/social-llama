If you build an army in smyrna (on the pretense of convoying it somewhere) then you can walk into sevastopol next year.

This is my guess because these are the promises they made to me not so long ago.

If you're tired of being manipulated in a game Italy feels they own, I have a proposal that might get us both destroyed, but at least we'll have stuck up for ourselves and perhaps minorly inconvenienced Italy on their path to victory.

Here's what I know: 1) we have to assume Italy is working with Russia.  So my Tyr-Tri is a lock. 2) we have to assume that Russia takes Ankara. 3) Barring very unusual moves, the only place we can possibly Rumania from is Budapest.  Exception to this is a sneaky Rum-Bul move, but that's unlikely. 4) *Almost* sure that Vienna has to hit Galacia, but depending on other moves supporting Budapest is almost as good.\"\nLabel 1: truth\nDocument 2: \"I think this set of moves is the safe, normal play here:  Russia A BUD-VIE A RUM S BUL-SER F BLA C ANK-BUL A SEV-UKR  Turkey A BUL-SER A ANK-BUL  I think there are other options as well, like if I supported Austria from Serbia to Trieste, allowing you to move into Serbia, keeping Austria at 3 centers and harming Italy.

Trying to get tricksy with supporting Austria forward sounds like a way to end up with hostile units in Galicia.   If I were going to put forth another option, it would probably be for you to rotate rum to gal while I tap Greece and Serbia - letting Budapest choose which move to support.\"\nLabel 4: truth\nDocument 5: \"Yeah, retrospect is easy.

Normally when playing Russia I try to grab a couple German centers around 1904, allowing me to hold over the stalemate line setting up a solo when I conquer the East. Since I'm not intending to solo in this game, however, it doesn't make sense to go after your centers. It would be much better for both of us, I believe, to agree to a pact of non aggression.
