I am outnumbered and I obviously can’t solo.

What I am doing is sowing some seeds of doubt with Italy - floating the idea that Russia and Turkey are working together, and backhandedly noting how bad it will be for him if they are, and they wipe you out quickly.  You have a best probabilistic set of moves, but the best you can realistically hope for is maybe 1 build if you go +Greece, +Serbia, -Trieste.  Maybe.  If I were you, I'd reach out to Italy.  Suggest that he take Tunis, and instead of forcing him out of Trieste, you'll take Greece and move on.  Tell him you're going to move to Trieste because it's your best move.  It is.  Request that he move to Vienna, because that's Russia's best move (it is) and you want to prevent him from getting another build.  You'd move Bud-Tri, and Ser S Alb-Gre.\"\nLabel 1: truth\nDocument 2: \"Oh so italy screwed you!

The reason for that is that I think Italy is far more duplicitous than any of us ever realized; right now they may be promising you that you'll take centers of mine, and maybe even that you two will share a victory together. This is my guess because these are the promises they made to me not so long ago. But we both need to face facts: Italy has never hesitated to profit from discord between us, and will always aid the weaker of us at the expense of the stronger.  If you're tired of being manipulated in a game Italy feels they own, I have a proposal that might get us both destroyed, but at least we'll have stuck up for ourselves and perhaps minorly inconvenienced Italy on their path to victory. This proposal involves France, who is more than willing to use their last few turns to fight back against Italy.

It’s also the bill of goods Russia’s been trying to sell Austria and I.   On the other hand that depends on us being able to trust what Russia is up to and frankly I’m not certain of him at all. I was committed to supporting A Ser into Bul this year in exchange for his support into Greece... but if we go back to the order log we can both see that didn’t happen.  What do you have in mind?

Then, we'll work together to get you into Trieste, which will make up for losing Rome and give you a shot at getting Venice back.

If you build an army in smyrna (on the pretense of convoying it somewhere) then you can walk into sevastopol next year. As an initial stab you will almost certainly be able to take Vienna with bohemia and trieste, followed by budapest with help from albania having moved to serbia. That’s russia down to two dots and you up to 11 with nary a cession from me. Meanwhile germany would be fending me off, so you’d not have to worry about german attacks on old-austria.  I’m still pretty inexperienced at this game, so if there’s some obvious issue here i’m not seeing just tell me.

The retrieved documents are mostly about the same alliance. While Document 5 suggests that the best way to keep the alliance strong is to be on par with the other nation in terms of size, Document 2 and Document 3 suggest that the alliance is already strong and the speaker is not necessarily aiming for parity. However, the input text specifically mentions keeping the other nations in the dark about the alliance. Therefore, the most appropriate label for this text is label ",
