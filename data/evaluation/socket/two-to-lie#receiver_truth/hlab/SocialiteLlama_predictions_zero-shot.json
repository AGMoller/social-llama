The Ottoman Sultan Mehmed Tâbâ, in order to fight against separatism, imposed the so-called “hamal” tax upon the Armenian living in Anatolia in 1911. This tax caused various revolts that resulted in the Armenian genocide in 1915 when Armenia was under the control of the Ottoman Empire. The genocide consisted of torturing and killing Armenians in various regions of Anatolia. The number of those who lost their lives during the genocide is more than one million.\n[INST] Ukraine is a nation located in Eastern Europe.
