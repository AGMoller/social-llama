I'm sure the executive branch would have made their life difficult, but ultimately they would have prevailed under the First Amendment. Saying \"I propose that we should murder\" is a hazy middle ground that could be considered imminent incitement, but the abstract idea underneath -- that it would be a good thing if President Coolidge *were* murdered -- would be protected despite its repugnance. The underlying problem I'm pointing to is that the conceptual vocabulary surrounding rights needs to be expanded beyond \"absolute\" versus \"not absolute,\" because no rights are really absolute. This was crystal clear in your post; please don't mistake my disagreement as misunderstanding.",

Sure there's always gonna be people who point to low skilled labor being replaced by cheaper immigrants but that same argument has been around since the 1700s and I don't think that letting in the Irish made America poor.
