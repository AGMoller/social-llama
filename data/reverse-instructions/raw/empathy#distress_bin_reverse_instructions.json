It was gruesome to hear one man's account of the story.  He said the shootings went on for 3 hours, and when stopped, it was only so they could load more ammunition and fire more.  I couldn't help but think about the people out in the crowd who where hit and killed.  It's disturbing just imagining that scene and the terror.  And then one man, George Salines, got a call no one would want.  That his daughter was among the 130 killed.  The loss has affected his whole life, he left his job and everything.  In one moment, anyone can be affected by severe tragedy.\nLabels: ['not distress', 'distress bin']\nOutput: distress bin\nWhat kind of instruction could \"Output\" be the answer to given \"Input\" and \"Labels\"?

I just read an very disturbing article about a 23 year old male teacher charged with multiple counts of child pornography that was taking place at the school he teached in. He managed to get away with this crime for a very long time as he lured hundreds of children into his scheme before finally getting busted. It really pisses me off that scum bags like this are allowed near our children and I hope he gets a max sentence!\nLabels: ['not distress', 'distress bin']\nOutput: distress bin\nWhat kind of instruction could \"Output\" be the answer to given \"Input\" and \"Labels\"?

There were three U.S. military trainers killed in gunfire by security units at Jordan base, fatally shot by security forces Friday when their vehicle failed to stop at the gate of a military base. I have no idea why the driver did not stop at the gate, which is certainly protocol.
